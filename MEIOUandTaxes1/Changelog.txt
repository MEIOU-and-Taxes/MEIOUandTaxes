### System Changes
- Migration System:
	- The amount of possible migrants from the peasantry now scales with tenacy rights and peasant freedom
	- Added a modification which modifies migration speed into cities the further you are from the amenities cap (faster if below, slower if ahead)
	- Added a forced migration system and menu to allow for the player (no AI yet) to move population around
		- Population movement costs ducats and military monarch power and is based on a multitude of factors
		- Ducat costs gets reinvested into the pops wealth pool and infrastructure in the source/target provinces
		- Dependent on how much population is moved national or local effects on stability and unrest can occur
		- Dependent on province setup forced migration can help with ongoing culture conversions
		- to be done: 
			- Make forced migration influence religious setups
			- Make forced migration influence local elite loyalty
	- Added a local Promotion/Demotion system so that pops can move between classes in their own province (Atm only used for Peasants -> Residents)
		- Promotion/Demotion works with an ideal resting point for each class, which is derived from a multitude of metrics
		- Currently this system mainly does allow for cities to grow out of their local peasantry pool, which helps with overall lower migrant amount and small nations city growth
		- Promotion/Demotion happens as a percentage of current class size vs. ideal resting point usually at about 2% of the difference per year

- Population Growth System:
	- Increased death rates the further away a city is from the amenities cap
		-> slightly increased general city death rates to get closer to historical city growths
	- Increased peasant birth rate for provinces with lots of unused rural land capacity (settlement of north america, stepps etc.)

### System Changes
- Major CE balancing and additions
	- Reworked the base formula (credit CC) for pathing contributions to CE, with pathing providing significantly less base time improvement, but also significantly better terrain penalty reduction
	- Reworked the Nomad CE bonus, now a direct improvement to base time, reduced by Pathing ranks, replacing the prior +2 Pathing Rank method.
	- Added a new CE Paths system, following major historial roads central to Empires including the Silk Road, the Royal Road,  Via Militaris, etc.
	- Travel along these routes requires a continous road to travel along, and a city to depart from, to gain the benefits of path travel
	- Paths provide major reductions in Innate/Forest penalties, and a more upfront benefit for Pathing with diminishing returns for higher end Pathing infrastructure
	- River CE now requires a harbourage to embark from, can disembark from any river province, improving CE performance in large empires
	- Capitols have been rebalanced, with regional capitals being generally less upfront effective and capital capitols having empire wide bonuses
	- Added display for whether rivers or paths are in a province to the Terrain modifier, also added a corresponding Paths mapmode
- Added two new Clan interactions and the framework for many new future Clan interactions
- Adjustments to Infrastructure system especially AI behavior
	- Infrastructure Wealth Pool
		- Now not only elites but also the lower classes will pay for the provincial infrastructure wealth pool
		- The numbers for how much the elites invest have been slightly adjusted
		- Amount of investment now has more key influences, which are the following:
			- For noble and lower classes the investment amount is increased for provinces which are commercialized
			- Burghers and Residents now have opposite investment patterns based on City Government Rights, 
			  where Burghers invest more in tags with autonomous cities and residents more with bureacratic governed cities
	- Affect of amenities on city population cap has been adjusted to make additional units above previous rank give 50% cap a unit would give if a rank was fully completed
	- Interest in classes to built provincial infrastructure
		- Key adjustments which resulted mainly in more interest to built up or at least support the current resident population with amenities
		- Decreased interest in CE buildings and garrisons (might still be too high atm
		- Slightly changed up which classes invest in which infrastructure type
	- We completely reworked the State Building AI in the following fashion:
		- The AI now has a money pool out of its treasury (with some ducats always saved), which is invested in the following pattern
			- 25 % into CE buildings, out of which 33 % can potentially invested in building a Capitol when needed
				- Capitols are built either if necessary to reduce autonomy (CE) or when necessary for reform (BU privileges)
			- 75 % into Amenities, out of which 55 % go into prioritized cities and 45 % into all other cities
				- Prioritized cities are the capital plus the 3 largest owned cities
				- AI tries to build amenities, when the following threshhold vs. cap is reached: normal 110 %, prio 80 %
				- if money isnt enough for an entire project, it only tries to built a few units to allow the city to grow
			- Money can trickle between those budget, if it isn't used, where the priority order is: 
				- 1. CE infrastructure -> 2. Normal Cities amenities, 3. Prio Cities amenities
				- This way any leftover budget of the previous will be used for the latest with prio cities usually getting the largest share of cash
		- For now the State AI will not invest in Garrisons or Irrigation as the provinces

##### Open Alpha 24

### System Changes
	- Update M&T to latest EU4 version (1.36.2 as of writing this changelog)
	- Added 39 new nodes in a massive node expansion, equalizing node counts, distances and improving scoping
		- New links between India, Aden and Malacca, creating a more direct path for trade
		- Reduction in direct links around the Atlantic, with links in North America merged into Eastern Seaboard
		- A new focus on Coastal/Sea and Inland/Land division of trade nodes to utilise the new trade system more efficiently, and reduce foreign access to inland interiors
	- Rebalanced trade center assignments to be more dependent on the node shares and as such keep a more consistent number of centers
	- Major rebalancing of commerce power along key trade routes, boosting capacity along major links and areas struggling with transport
	- More balancing of natural features, notably in Japan and India.
	- Added limited Trade Hopping along the Silk Road for Major TNs, to improve flow of goods
	- Added Trade Posts for Ragusa in the Balkans
	- Food and Life demand have seen a radical rebalance, with notably higher food demand, new food pricing and overall a lower fulfilment economy
		- Food demand has been raised 20%, and other life goods raised as well, with peasant spending on demand slightly down overall
		- Base Price for food is partially back, now set at 50% of the difference between 'base' food price and the sector price, to allow more stable production and more famines/fulfilment issues
		- Salt has been notably rebalanced, with more salt production in critical and struggling areas but less production overall
		- The Initial sim has new logic to better apply balancing throughout the process to stabilise class wealth around the world and reduce edge cases
		- Allow more Elite demand for comfort/luxury to reduce 500% fulfil scenarios
	- Added support and display of 'CE from Regional Centers', allowing easy visualisation in CE modifiers of the benefit of Regional Centers

	- Remove manual tax buildings from macro builder
	- Limit autoinvestor to provinces with at least 2.5 State Reach, for both AI and player
	- Industry Expansion heuristic changes:
		- We completely revamped the industry expansion (/shrinkage) heuristic used by industries intrinsic expansion, because the old heuristic created unrealistic and usually wrong and slow expansions due to a mixture of bugs and bad design. The goal of a new heuristic was to simplify the players (and industries) understanding of when it will expand down to a very simple metric (profit).
		- The new heuristic is more aligned with the intuitive market understanding. Industries expand based on marginal cost aka profit or rather the margins of profit. As a rule of thumb that means that industries above 4% profit margin expand, between 4 and 0 % stay the same, and below 0% profit margin (loss) shrink.
		- Additionally there are some other factors influencing the desire to expand or shrink. First one being the industries throughput. Throughput is a metric of production in an optimal scenario and the actual production. If throughput gets low (usually this means missing input goods or labor) industries will want to expand less even if operating at a profit with the effect getting exponentially stronger the lower throughput gets.
		- Secondly industries will expand slower if the usage of their respective ressource size is drawing to be maxed out.
		- Besides those main determining factors the heuristic is influenced by certain API effects like important harbors etc.
	- Changes to State / Player Investements:
		- In order to make state investment more realistic and less overpowered compared to naturally occurring growth, we wanted to change the way on where, when and why to invest somewhere. This is done to make state investment less of a no brainer just dumping money in every single province and making it more integrated with other systems. It works now in the following way:
		- State investment takes money out of the states treasury. Then something new happens. Depending on the provinces corruption a certain amount of money is not actually getting invested, but siphoned away by the elites/bureaucrats into corruption so their own pockets. Therefore you really need to check where to invest based on provincial corruption and most likely keep money into the treasury at high corruption periods.
		- After the corruption step the remaining money is put into an investment pool which is per property type (visible in the property modifier).
		- Lastly the money is actually getting invested by demanding goods from the market to build up the property (before investment just nullified maintenance costs, which lead to buildup due to higher profits). The speed of investment is different though. It depends on the state reach in the province. The higher the state reach the faster money is actually getting invested. If state reach is zero, the state has no way to invest and the money is NOT getting invested.
		
### Optimisation
	- Neutral to positive performance impact from the trade rework
	- Optimisations to Trade to reduce the code size and impact of the script to accomodate the trade rework
	- CE optimisations to reuse more data and use less expensive triggers
	- Better balance out scripts across years using a new heuristic of on-map/in-use provinces and tags, for more consistent performance
	- Reduce the code size of the Census script, and move critical yearly code into its own smaller file to optimise perf
	- Fire province looting events and code instantly vs over random events within 3 days, to remove event calls from the stack and for fast trigger checks
	- Optimised the advisor system using new on-actions
	- Add daily tick optimisations
	- Optimize Theodosian Walls Canon checks
	- Remove property Maintenance buildings for the AI to save performance

### AI
	- Changed cutoffs for AI desires in interactions for loyalty and made them customizable per Elite. The following values were the cutoffs before: high loy desire <40 loy, med <55, low <70, none >=70
		- New Noble/Tribal desire cutoffs: High <55, Med <65, low <70, none >=70
		- New Burgher/Clergy desire cutoffs: High <45, Med <55, low <65, none >=65
		--> Higher desire to increase loyalty hard or softblocks reforming for the AI and loyalty costing interactions
	- Changed cutoffs for AI desires to decrease power of elites to make them invest less resources decreasing clergy or burgher power and focus on nobles.
	- Changed cutoffs for AI desires to make AI prioritize decreasing corruption of laws way earlier --> should prevent state reach spam without state privilege reforms
	- Differentiated the cutoffs for not making law reforms:
		- for nobility reforms:  
			- Rural Governance and Tenacy Reforms only to be changed not having med or high desire to increase noble loyalty
			- Noble Service and Noble Obligation can be changed already at medium desire for loyalty (>= 55 loyalty)
		- for BU Reforms: made it so that AI doesnt attempt BU reforms if desire for noble loyalty increase is high
		- for BG reforms: make BGCommerce only require reform desire not loyalty as it does give loyalty not cost
	- Taught AI which privileges it needs for which exact rights reform so that it doesnt waste resources reducing privileges to 0 before doing rights reforms
	- Tried to teach AI to use demote greater nobility when it only needs to reduce power to do a reform and all other requirements are fulfilled (not perfect yet, but should help them reform)
	- Adjusted lots of AI chances to use various privileges to encourage AI to do BU privilege when they need to decrease corruption and have high state reach
