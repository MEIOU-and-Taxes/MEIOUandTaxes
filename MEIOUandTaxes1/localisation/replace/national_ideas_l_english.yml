 liberalism_trait_desc:1 "This population is characterised by an 'absolute nuclear family' system, when adult children don't live with parents, and with no strict equal-inheritance custom. The father is free to distribute his possessions among his children by will. Indifferent to the notions of equality and inequality, little devoted to family solidarity, it is an individualistic model. This leads to a very liberal mentality about property, inheritance, order and economy. Individuals will be more likely and efficient to invest and create private businesses; but also less inclined to fight heresies because of their conception of freedom and autonomy. \n§RThis idea is not really giving its modifiers, but your Main Culture is.

 authoritarian_trait:1 "§GFamilial System :§! Authoritarian Family"
 authoritarian_trait_desc:1 "This population is characterised by a 'stem family' system, when one adult child (and his family) lives with parents and others move out; and with no strict equal-inheritance custom. Adult, only one of the sons (elder, younger or chosen by the father) marries and procreates without leaving his parents. Other children have the option of staying single in the family home or going away to marry, become priests or soldiers. These are compensated by cash payments. The cohabitation of two adult generations illustrates the authoritarianism of the system. The transmission of a large part of the patrimony to a single child and the celibacy, more or less accepted, of the others betray the inequality of the model. This leads to a very authoritarian mentality about inheritance, order and discipline. Therefore, this family system is very effective for the education of children and the transmission of values and new knowledge, but also quite self-contained. \n§RThis idea is not really giving its modifiers, but your Main Culture is.

 equality_trait:1 "§GFamilial System :§! Egalitarian Family"
 equality_trait_desc:1 "This population is characterised by an 'egalitarian nuclear family' system, when adult children don't live with parents; and with a strict equal-inheritance custom. The couple made children who, as adults, found independent households. Since the family never develops beyond the parent-child nucleus, this model contributes to individualism. As for the property of the parents, they are shared equitably, meticulously, among the descendants. Hence a very strong sensitivity to the notions of equality. This leads to a very egalitarian mentality about property, inheritance, order and economy.	This population has a penchant for universalism and thus is very efficient to export its system of values, even by conquest; but also has a natural reject for order. \n§RThis idea is not really giving its modifiers, but your Main Culture is.

This system corresponds to a community family system where the preferential marriage between first-degree cousins, derived from a hypertrophy of the brother-sister relationship, is observed. This leads to a very familial and communal mentality about property, inheritance, economy and order.

Absalon broke the Wendish fleet, which attacked the small city of Hafn (Literally Harbour, would later be known as Copenhagen), which were his personal domain. The campaign formally ended with the capture of the Wendish stronghold of Arkona in 1168 on the island of Rügen, where Absalon toppled the statue of Svetovid, the Wendish deity of war, fertility and abundance. The capital Charenza of the Rani tribe surrendered a few days later, legends say that 6000 Wendish warriors watched Bishop Absalon burn the seven-faced god Rugiwit. The whole population were then baptized, and Absalon laid the foundations of twelve churches in the isle of Rügen.

The road followed the watershed of the Jutland or Cimbrian peninsular, to avoid most rivers. Making the otherwise rough terrain of the peninsular travelable. As the name suggest the road had both military and trade usage, the most important however was the oxen trade, which where a large income source for the region but it was not limited to cattle: Amber, hides, honey and fur went south.

 golden_bull_1214_idea_desc:1 "In 1214 Frederik II, the Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, signed a Golden Bull giving away all German territory north of the rivers Elbe and Elde to Valdemar the Victorious. The reason for this was a series of Danish conquests in the civil war between Frederik II and Otto IV. Otto IV was one of the claimants to the Imperial Throne, with a powerbase in Northern Germany, himself being of the House of Welf, and an alliance with England he challenged Frederik II von Hohenstaufen. Due to Danish, French, and Papal support Frederik II emerged victorious. One reason being the support from the Danish King Valdemar, which tied up Otto's vassals, The Danish conquest included Stormarn, Wagrien, Ratzeburg, Travemünde, Lauenburg and the rich trading cities of Hamburg and Lübeck, and with the signing of the Golden Bull even more. The Golden Bull were a significant change to the power balance of Northern Europe, 100 years earlier Denmark had fought the Emperor to avoid becoming vassals themselves. The reasons this was accomplished were the continued centralisation of the Danish state under Knud Lavard, Valdemar the Great, Canute VI and Valdemar the Victorious himself, Denmark had at this point finished a transformation of being a backwards pagan kingdom on the periphery of Europe. To a true modern feudal kingdom integrated into European society, population wise the Kingdom was at its zenith and would only reach the same number of people in the nineteenth century. The result was that the Danish kings were capable of raising large armies that could go toe to toe with anything Europe had to offer."

As such, the largest fleet to sail from Denmark, sailed towards Estonia, led by the Danish king Valdemar the Victorious, fresh from victories in northern Germany. The fleet were a result of years of preparation and negotiations with Pope Honorius III, which in 1218 allowed Valdemar II to annex as much land as he could conquer in Estonia. The fleet, which included vassals from Rügen, Mecklenburg, Holstein and more is said to have been 1500 ships strong, which if correct would have resulted in an invasion force of 30,000-60,000 men. On landing, the army started to build a castle, which would late be known by the Estonians as Danish Town, or Tallinn. It is here that the Battle of Lyndanisse was fought. A battle where the Estonians tried to throw the invaders back into the sea. The legend about the Danish flag has its origins from the Battle of Lyndanisse: The Dannebrog fell from the sky, as a gift from god to the Danes, inspiring the Danish troops to fight on, and ultimately win the battle."

Danes, Germans, Poles and Swedes participated in the Northern crusades that lasted for nearly 100 years, and succeeding in converting much of the Baltic to Christianity. While hotly debated if they were part actual papal approved crusades, Sweden launched several campaigns against heathen Finnish tribes. The so called Second Swedish Crusade led by Birger Jarl succeeded in subjugating western Finland in the winter of 1249-50, later under the Third Swedish Crusade in 1293, Sweden conquered the Karelian tribes.

Landskapen all abided their own sets of laws and rights that had been agreed upon in the local tings. These laws went under name Landskapslagar. However in the increasingly centralised state that was the Kingdom of Sweden there was an ever-increasing desire to replace these laws with common laws that would apply to the entire realm, landslagar. The first set of landslagar took effect in 1350 under the reign of King Magnus Eriksson and amongst many things these laws made the ownership of thralls (slaves) illegal and established elective monarchy as the form of succession for the Crown of Sweden. While Magnus Erikssons Landslag would be modified throughout history it would remain the basis of the legal system in Sweden until as far as 1734 when it was fully replaced by Sveriges Rikes Lag which remains as the core legal system of both modern day Sweden and Finland."

It is notable for many reasons, including for an early mention of the concept of popular sovereignty. The Declaration was signed by 51 Scottish magnates and nobles and it convinced the Pope to try and persuade the English to make peace with the Scots. Although peace would not come for another eight years, the Declaration of Arbroath was integral to the definition of the Scottish state and identity, encapsulated by the famous quote: 'As long as only one hundred of us remain alive we will never on any conditions be brought under English rule.'"

It was rediscovered in the early fifteenth century and was quickly embraced as source of legal authority, given that much of Scottish law documents had been seized and destroyed by the confiscations of Edward I.

 japan_trait:1 "§GBonus Idea :§! Eastern Asia - Japanese Armours"
 japan_trait_desc:1 "Japanese armour is thought to have evolved from the armour used in ancient China and Korea. Cuirasses and helmets were manufactured in Japan as early as the fourth century. Tankó, worn by foot soldiers and keikó, worn by horsemen were both pre-samurai types of early Japanese cuirass constructed from iron plates connected together by leather thongs. During the Heian period (794-1185), the Japanese cuirass evolved into the more familiar style of armour worn by the samurai known as the dou or dó. Japanese armour makers started to use leather (nerigawa) and lacquer was used to weather proof the armour parts. By the end of the Heian period the Japanese cuirass had arrived at the shape recognised as being distinctly samurai. Leather and or iron scales were used to construct samurai armours, with leather and eventually silk lace used to connect the individual scales (kozane) which these cuirasses were now being made from."

 gunki_monogatari_desc:1 "Gunki Monogatari, or war tales, are a type of Japanese literature that were especially popular during the Kamakura and Muromachi periods. Gunki Monogatari works emphasised the code of warrior ethics, and were indicative of a hybrid Chinese-Japanese writing style that at times blended prose and poetry. The most famous work of this type is the Heiki Monogatari (or Tale of the Heike), which depicted the twelfth century conflict between the Taira and Minamoto clans during the Genpei War; other prominent works in the genre include the Hogen Monogatari and Heiji Monogatari."
 five_mountain_system:1 "Five Mountain System"
 five_mountain_system_desc:1 "The Five Mountain System refers to a dual set of ranked temples in Kyoto and Kamakura, known as the Gozan, that were both protected and controlled by the Shogunate government. The formalization of the Five Mountain System during the Kemmu Restoration helped to institutionalize the dominance of the Rinzai school of Zen Buddhism in Japan. Building off an initiative begun by Ashikaga Takauji and Ashikaga Tadayoshi, in 1345 Emperor Kogon issued an edict calling for the development of a series of provincial temples to be constructed throughout Japan, consisting of Ankoku-ji temples (controlled by the local governors) and Risho-to pagodas (controlled by the Gozan), further increasing the influence of the Five Mountain System."

 kemmu_restoration_desc:1 "The Kenmu Restoration was a three-year period of imperial Japanese rule that lasted from 1333 to 1336. Coming between the Kamakura and Muromachi periods, the Kenmu Restoration was an attempt to restore the power of the Emperor, as opposed to that of the Shogun. Emperor Go-Daigo attempted to rein in the power of the local lords and governors, but failed to properly reward his troops. Corruption was rife and Emperor Go-Daigo quickly became unpopular, especially among the warrior class, and the Emperor was ultimately overthrown by the Ashikaga brothers, Takauji and Tadayoshi, beginning the era of the Ashikaga shogunate and the chaos of the Northern and Southern Courts period."

Though the post of Shugo is said to have been created in 1185 by Minamoto no Yoritomo, the Shugo lords gained a substantial amount of power in the fourteenth century. The Ashikaga installed many related families as Shugo, including the Hosokawa and Shiba, but many other powerful families, like the Togashi and Sasaki, also remained. In 1372, the Shugo lords were given the responsibility to collect taxes known as tansen from all landowners, which greatly enhanced their own power. Though the Ashikaga attempted to rein in the power of the Shugo in the 1380s and 1390s, many Shugo lords remained semi-independent, especially those farther away from the capital."

 the_katana_idea_desc:1 "The Katana is perhaps the most famous piece of Japanese weaponry. One of the traditional swords of Japan, the Katana is characterised by its distinctive construction: curved, with a single-edged blade and a long grip large enough to accommodate two hands. The Katana developed from an earlier sword known as a Tachi and, starting around the year 1400, swords signed with the 'Katana' signature were beginning to be produced. With the development of the Katana, samurai began to move away from being archers in favour of swordsmen, as the new sword radically changed the nature of close-combat warfare. The Katana was used into the twentieth century and, even today, it remains largely unchanged from its fourteenth century origins."

Nkisi were not necessarily always seen as malevolent forces, however. When used for selfish purposes, use of Nkondi constituted black magic and witchcraft, but when directed publicly for communal purposes, was a form of positive spiritual protection.

 wildbann_desc:1 "Franconia was filled with vast forests, like the Spessart in its south western corner. The 'Wildbann', roughly 'deer-ban', was a law that restricted the usage of these forests. In earlier centuries it marked forests where only the king was allowed to hunt, but later it was also used to justify and claim clearings and new settlements on former forest territory of any kind, even if the woods were long gone, thus a common excuse for fabricated claims."

In 1268 all foreign merchants travelling to or living in Leipzig got safe conduct for their persons and their goods, even if their Rulers were at war with Saxony. This led to the settlement of numerous merchants in Leipzig. Trade goods now included herring, cloth, wine, and pepper."

In their stead we have developed a lighter, faster and more manoeuvrable adaptation of the basic design, with a similar, but shallower and flatter hull, and fewer oars. This design proved so effective that it dominated warfare in the Isles well into the sixteenth century. It also provided great utility as a civilian ship, finding common use in daily life, primarily for fishing, this being the source of much of the isles' food supply."

Both of these cultures have given us great traditions of martial bravery and personal ferocity, as they demand that our soldiers not think twice before plunging headlong into battle, and conduct themselves with dauntless fury. As a result of this, our warriors, while often ill-disciplined, are a fearsome foe and the match of any more standardised army."

 chinese_ideas_3_desc:1 "The Mandate is an idea fundamental to the realm of the Han, leaving the fate of the dynasty in the hands of the people.

 chinese_ideas_4: "Bureaucratic Rule"
 chinese_ideas_4_desc:1 "Ever since the Qin broke the many kingdoms of the Warring States period, China has known one realm under a strong guiding hand.

 korean_ideas_2: "Heir of Three Kingdoms"
 korean_ideas_2_desc:1 "Our realm is still influenced by the times of the Three Kingdoms, when Silla, Baekje and Goruryeo divided our people across a great distance. Our modern states descend from Goruryeo, yet the legacy of all three forms the cultural genesis of our realm."
 korean_ideas_3: "The Eastern Kingdom"

 mongol_ideas_4: "Southern Peoples"
 mongol_ideas_4_desc:1 "Those beyond our homeland have long interacted with our people in both tribute and war, and no realm has left its mark like the Middle Kingdom.

 mongol_ideas_5: "True Fear"
 mongol_ideas_5_desc:1 "In our conquests we have always known the value of fear, and how to instil such terror in your enemies that they bow before you upon even a whisper of your arrival. Those who submit may be spared. Those who resist will suffer."
 mongol_ideas_6: "Religious Indifference"
 mongol_ideas_6_desc:1 "Across all lands the Mongolchuud have seen many faiths, many ideas and ways of life that greatly differ to our own. And generally we have shown indifference. The value of an individual is in their use to the clan, regardless of what false god they pray to."
 mongol_ideas_7: "Endless Frontier"
 mongol_ideas_7_desc:1 "Those who exist in lands of comfort, of stone houses and brick walls always see a limit, a line that must not be crossed. There is no end to our frontier. We will travel any distance in the pursuit of value within this life, at any distance, at any cost."

 turkic_ideas_4: "Cultural Syncretism"
 turkic_ideas_4_desc:1 "Our people are no strangers to those beyond the Steppe, and despite our differences we do not fear their ways. Instead, we embrace those we conquer, and use their strengths for ourselves."
 turkic_ideas_5: "Silk Road"
 turkic_ideas_5_desc:1 "Many caravans have passed through the mountains and trails left behind by traders past, forming a single pathway for trade that often crosses our own lands. Their riches are something to be valued, to be encouraged for our own gain.\nMerchant from Trade Centres: §G+10.0%§!"
 turkic_ideas_6: "Mongolic Influences"

 jurchen_ideas_2: "Land of Rivers"
 jurchen_ideas_2_desc:1 "Across the realm from end to end, rivers sprawl across the landscape, connecting settlements and clans through river transport that flows out to sea. We understand the value of the river, and its ability to bind a realm.\nHarbourage Infrastructure Cost: §G-10.0%§!"
 jurchen_ideas_3: "Evolving Lifestyle"
 jurchen_ideas_3_desc:1 "Our people know many lifestyles, from sedentary agriculture, hunting and fishing, as well as the value of husbandry and the horse. We are diverse in our way of life, and will use all means available to thrive."
 jurchen_ideas_4: "Heirs of the Jin"
 jurchen_ideas_4_desc:1 "Our people have already once migrated beyond our homeland, forming the mighty empire of the Jin, and conquering much of the Middle Kingdom. While its time has since passed and our people dispersed across its remains, our people have not forgotten what was, and what can be."
 jurchen_ideas_5: "Tribute in Service"
 jurchen_ideas_5_desc:1 "At the crossroads of peoples, many from afar call upon our clans to serve as tribute to their Kingdoms and Empires. Our time abroad has exposed us to many ways of war, and left a martial culture in its place amongst our people.\nAvailable Manpower Pool: §G+15.0%§!"
 jurchen_ideas_6: "Mongolic Influences"
 jurchen_ideas_6_desc:1 "When the Jin ended, the Mongolchuud took their place and conquered many Jurchen clans. Our time in their shadow has left a marked influence on our society, from language to culture, as well as the importance of cavalry."
 jurchen_ideas_7: "Regional Competition"
 jurchen_ideas_7_desc:1 "As new realms form and old ones return anew, our people will once again remain at the centre of regional conflicts. We will have to navigate this new landscape to protect our people and preserve the clans"

Even in conquest the idea of Balgariya has endured, surviving over a century of Greki domination to return to independence and prosperity once more."
 bulgarian_ideas_3: "Land of Plenty"
 bulgarian_ideas_3_desc: "The wealth of our people is well renowned across the region, our people famed for wine, wax and honey. Whether it be bountiful grain harvests, plentiful mines or prestigious furs and fabrics, the abundance of our land has seen us propser in the most challenging of times.\nDelicacy Output: §G+5.0%§!\nMines Output: §G+5.0%§!"
 bulgarian_ideas_4: "Slavonic Christianity"
 bulgarian_ideas_4_desc: "Since the Council of Preslav, our people have been united under our own Christian faith, free from foreign domination. We appoint our own bishops, speak our native tongue and write in our own Slavonic script; a free faith that has inspired our northern and western kin.\nSpirituality Concern: §Y+25.0%§!"
 bulgarian_ideas_5: "Southern Friction"
 bulgarian_ideas_5_desc: "From the founding of the first Empire our people have fought and treatied with our Southern kin, defending a porous border that has seen our victory and defeat alike. Through war and diplomacy our realm endures, forever finding a path forward with our southern kin, adopting their strengths while exploting their weaknesses."
 bulgarian_ideas_6: "Urban Defence"
 bulgarian_ideas_6_desc: "Across the empire our cities are founded in locations safe from those who would invade our lands, raising sturdy walls, building forts at heights above the clouds. Our land is a fortress, our people prepared for the wars of the realm and the ravages of any aspirant invader.\nGarrison Cost: §R-10%§!"
 bulgarian_ideas_7: "The Second Empire"
 bulgarian_ideas_7_desc: "From the ashes of our state we have once more freed our people, united under a new Empire that has seen both prosperity and glory, modelling our state on the efficient administration of the Greki. Though we have seen our realm decline over the last century, the strength of our people endures.\nElite Power from Autonomy: §G-10.0%§!"

 khmer_ideas_1_desc: "It is here, upon the plains of a mighty river and an eternal lake, that our nation has found its form. The waters shape our awareness of the world and proclaim the path forward. So too has our capability of controlling our waters increased, with bridges, dams, and reservoirs taking shape across the realm. Control of the waters and their use gives the rulers a firm guiding hand across the nation and strengthens our will in the face of adversity. \nIrrigation Build Cost: §G-10%§!"
 khmer_ideas_2: "Perfect Union"
 khmer_ideas_2_desc: "Various claims and legends reach from the mists of the past to describe our awakening, too many to count. But all share a common theme - the Khmer people have emerged from the union of an adventuring brahmin and a mystical princess. Whichever of these claims is true, the effect is the same. We know that the strength of a union is far more powerful than division, greater than any of our enemies would dare to dream…"
 khmer_ideas_3: "Religious Flux"
 khmer_ideas_3_desc: "The hearts and minds of our people and kings are a battleground, beset with concerns over the spiritual future of the realm. Few rulers feel truly confident in their declarations of divine blessing and the common people are even less sure – of which temple to attend, which relics to venerate. With time this will pass, and a spiritual calm will settle over us. For now, we can only wait and see what the heavens have in store."
 khmer_ideas_4: "Cities and Temples"
 khmer_ideas_4_desc: "Our legacy is not that of a nation of farmers and hunters. Our kings and nobles have laid forth great constructs the like of which has never been seen! Jayavarman II alone founded three great cities, and each successive ruler has seen fit to add to the grandeur. Not just cities but temples, such as Bayon and Ta Prohm, proclaiming our piety. And finally, the most impressive of them all – Angkor. At once a city of incredible splendor and a monument to our faith in the highest powers, all shall look upon our works in wonder."
 khmer_ideas_5: "Khmer Literacy"
 khmer_ideas_5_desc: "A point of pride throughout our recorded history is that it is, in fact, recorded. Unlike many of our neighbours, we have a long custom of record-keeping and a proud literary tradition. So important are our writing capabilities that almost every nearby script is derived from our own. The Khmer script, established so long ago, perhaps even before the foundation of the empire itself, is our gift to the world and a sign of our intellectual prowess."
 khmer_ideas_6: "Royal Hospitals"
 khmer_ideas_6_desc: "Beyond cities and temples, there is another construct somewhat more unique to our nation - the ak-roak-sala, or 'anti-sickness places'. This term derives from the Sanskrit arogyasala, referring to the hospital of the god Ranganatha. By the time of Jayavarman VII, there were over 100 of these in the empire, devoted to treating ailments and preventing disease, even using the royal stores of tinctures and medicines to treat the lowliest peasant. This experience of caring for our people is not lightly ignored.\nBase Diversions: §G+0.50§!\nBase Welfare: §G+0.75§!"
 khmer_ideas_7: "Mother of Nations"
 khmer_ideas_7_desc: "From our bosom many nations have sprung forth. As the empire waxes and wanes new states and lords rise up in unexpected places, creating a legacy that links them back to us. While it is a rare nation that looks to us as a faithful child ought to, the bonds of matrimony are truly, truly, unshakeable."

 latin_ideas_1_desc: "Italy has lent itself well to urban life ever since the days of Ancient Rome. With its mountainous, hilly terrain, it only makes sense that we must utilize the greatest amount of land we can, with what we can. So we have learned how to build great, and awe-inspiring cities, built with the ruins of one of the world’s greatest civilizations. Protected by both ancient defenses and new castelli, not a single defender will come to touch our walls. \nResident Attraction: §G+5%§!"

At times this can lead to riots, insurrection and rebellion. However, it can also lead to inspiration, thoughtful debate and innovative governing strategies. As much as our cities are a whirlwind of debate and discussion, they are a shining beacon of creativity, intellectualism and artistic expression.\nState Corruption from Reforms: §G-25%§! \nProvincial Corruption from Reforms: §G-5.0%§!"
 latin_ideas_3: "A Learned Society"
 latin_ideas_3_desc: "Italy was the very first in Europe to found a Universitas, or, University in 1088. This was soon mimicked by almost every other Northern Italian city-state, in competition with each other to gain an edge in our rapidly urbanizing surroundings. Learning from ancient Romans like Gratian, we will apply our men so that they can succeed great efforts. They shall be educated, worldly and by the grace of God, may they create such works as to make even the dullest peasant weep. \nAcademia Outputs: §G+5%§!"
 latin_ideas_4: "Commercialisation"
 latin_ideas_4_desc: "Our cities have swelled over the centuries. Teeming with people, goods and gorgeous markets. Our rural areas are generally ill suited for sustaining our urban population on their own. So our merchants have long since sought out lands beyond our borders. From Sicily, to Egypt to as far as Crimea, our merchants go in search of goods to feed the hungry mouths of our people. Because of this experience, our people are well known for their ability to trade far distances, using family and company to keep close trade links over vast distances."
 latin_ideas_5: "Trecento"
 latin_ideas_5_desc: "Our cities are currently flourishing with the arts, a period known as “Trecento” has been embraced throughout our artistic circles. As new ideas and masterwork creations are made here, they reach far and foreign lands. They know an Italian made this, as its craftsmanship is impeccable and its aesthetic is sublime."
 latin_ideas_6: "Rural Communes"
 latin_ideas_6_desc: "The rural people of Italy have come under hard times as of late. With more and more clearings being done on the land over the centuries, and the urban elite gaining more control of rural holdings. Our rural communes have generally become an arm of the administrative wing of the urban power structure. Speculators, investors and landlords have swarmed the land, forcing the peasantry to grow crops that are beneficial for the market, but not for the growth and health of a village.\nPeasant Attraction: §R-5%§! \nDelicacies Output: §G+5%§! \nLuxury Outpu: §G+5%§!"

We will hire scores of highly trained professionals to do the fighting for us. Why sacrifice our glorious artisans and merchants to war, when we could just pay other people to do it for us?"
