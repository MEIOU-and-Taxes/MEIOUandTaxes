Sometimes individuals are sent and are called missionaries.\n\nWe can work with our Clergy to focus our conversion efforts on specific provinces. For that, we have two ways to go about it:\n- send a missionary in a province and focus on that province\n- red-pin several provinces and ask missionaries to convert those provinces\n\nIn both cases, you can ask them to convert up to either 50% or 90% of the population to your religion.\n\n§RBeware§!: Missionaries sent this way will not accept to go in provinces with unrest.\n\nMissionary will end his mission once the conversion goal is reached, if the missionary strength drops too low or if there is unrest in the province.\n\nAt any point, you can recall your missionaries. If they are converting a majority community (missionary visible on the map), they'll finish their conversion activity and come home. If they are dealing with minority coommunities (through province modifier), they will be back at the following turn of the month."
