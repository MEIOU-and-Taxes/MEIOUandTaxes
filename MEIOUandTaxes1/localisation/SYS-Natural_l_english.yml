Jump_Definition: "§OJumping a Node§!: It is the action where a Sector can reach another Node which is not a direct neighbour. If we have Nodes §T'A-B-C'§!, §TA§! would reach §TC§! through §TB§!. Majors can do it once, while Dominants con do it twice. For example if §TA-B-C-D§!, a Dominant could reach §TD§! directly if they own in §TB§! and §TC§!. After reaching it's final destination, it will also be able to trade with every Important, Major or Dominant of all Neighboring nodes where the jump ended. If we had §TA-B-C-D-E§!, a Dominant would jump up to §TD§!, trade with everything inside, (as well as everything inside §TB§! and §TC§!) and lastly connect with every Important, Major or Dominant of §TE§!.
