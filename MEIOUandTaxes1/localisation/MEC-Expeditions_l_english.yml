 MEC_Expeditions.848.desc:"When expeditions are sent they have a 40% chance of successful landing at their target area, which can be increased to 80% with the first colonialism idea. Otherwise they get one of the failure options which brings back nothing, maps, or maps and some ducats.\nOnce it is determined an expedition successfully landed there is a calculation for which province it landed at, which randomly loops through a bunch of provinces in the target area to evaluate their score and picks the one with the lowest score.\nUncolonized provinces will be picked before owned provinces, with their scores determined by their rank of habour and natural feature. If all the provinces are owned then the owner of the province with the lowest score will get an event with the option to sell the province or defend it. If they choose to defend it then the chance of the expedition sender taking the province is their military tech level minus the province's defensive score divided by 10.\nThe province's defensive score is calculated by mil tech, plus defensive bonus which consists of 2 + 2 * fort level, minus 5 if colony, plus bonus depending on sum of taxed manpower in province by the state and all of the elites, plus bonus based on size of the province.\nIf the expedition sender has mil tech 20 and the province defensive score is 15, and the owner decides to defend, the sender would have 50% chance of taking the province after landing. It is not directly 50% after landing because at worse odds owners are more likely to choose to sell the province than try to defend. Thus a 5 point advantage actually gives the sender approximately 64% chance of gaining a province after successfully landing."
