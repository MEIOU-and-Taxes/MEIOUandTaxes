##Demak conquered Kalapa in 1524/1525 but probably never ruled it directly
##Demak set up the sultanate of BAN and may have done the same for Jayakarta,
##but for simplicity Kalapa is treated as a province of BAN.
##According to MC Ricklefs "A History of Modern Indonesia", by 1618 Jayakarta was
##a troublesome vassal state of BAN
##PJJ assumes the mantle of the last hinduism state in western Java
