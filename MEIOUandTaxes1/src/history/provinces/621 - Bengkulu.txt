#Province: Bengkulu
#file name: 621 - Bengkulu
# MEIOU-FB Indonesia mod
#Note: if MEIOU ever has a start date prior to 1280 then this province should be part of the
#Srivijaya Empire.
#
#FB: according to MC Ricklefs "A History of Modern Indonesia" & "Cassell's Atlas of World History"
#Atjeh control never came this far south. Very little information is available on this province between
#the demise of the Srivijaya Empire and the Dutch taking control but is marked as a region of
#city-states in 1492 and the dutch took control of existing towns so it should not really be natives.
#However, there is not enough data to create a country just for this province and it would make
#the countries of Palembang and Lampung unrealistically large if this province was part of them.
#Consequently the province has been treated as natives prior to the dutch takeover.
