# 597 - Johor
#according to MC Ricklefs "A History of Modern Indonesia"
#after the Portguese take over of Malacca, the port of
#Malacca slowly declines in favour of the port of Riau in Johor
#(After Riau is destroyed by the Dutch in 1784 the nearby port of
#Singapore begins to be the dominant port in the region)
#Note: if MEIOU ever has a start date prior to 1280 then this province should be part of the
#Srivijaya Empire.
