## and smolensk was in alliance with lithuania from 1340 to 1370, and then with moscow from 1370 to 1387, then with lithuania again from until 1392, when prince yuri was exiled as the result of a city revolt, his brother became the ruler, and then in 1401 yuriy got his throne back, and finally in 1404 smolensk was annexed by lithuania. hopefully youll use that.
