# SYU - Syunia

#Syunik conquered in 1166 and not independent again until 1991
#Kingdom of Artsakh possibly independent until conquest by Qara Qoyunlu?
#Melikdom of Khachen appears to be the best option, as it survived in some form until 1603
#Melikdoms of Karabakh could also work, as it encompassed five Melikdoms

#GG-Syunik was an autonomous vassal of the Mongols and the Turks.
#Khachen seems less important, and we don't have post-1356 rulers.
#Khachen could later be added if we have more data.
