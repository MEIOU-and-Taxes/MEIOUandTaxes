Sometimes individuals are sent and are called missionaries.\n\nWe can work with our Clergy to focus our conversion efforts on specific provinces. For that, we have two ways to go about it:\n- send a missionary in a province and focus on that province\n- red-pin several provinces and ask missionaries to convert those provinces\n\nIn both cases, you can ask them to convert up to either 50% or 90% of the population to your religion.\n\n§RBeware§!: Missionaries sent this way will not accept to go in provinces with unrest.\n\nMissionary will end his mission once the conversion goal is reached, if the missionary strength drops too low or if there is unrest in the province.\n\nAt any point, you can recall your missionaries. If they are converting a majority community (missionary visible on the map), they'll finish their conversion activity and come home.

He has a legitimate claim to the throne but lacks control over the army or treasury of [From.GetName].  With [Root.GetAdjective] help he might seize the throne - or at least sow chaos in his homeland.  Alternatively, we could turn this visit into an opportunity to ingratiate ourselves with our neighbours."

A claimant to the [Root.GetAdjective] throne arrived in [From.Capital.GetName] seeking an army to return and seize the throne from [Root.Monarch.GetName].  Instead, he was executed by his hosts and his head has been returned to us.  This visible proof of his death will help provide legitimacy for our rule.

A claimant to the [Root.GetAdjective] throne arrived in [From.Capital.GetName] seeking an army to return and seize the throne from [Root.Monarch.GetName].  Instead, he was imprisoned by his hosts.  They tell us that they are willing to keep him in prison for the rest of his life - as long as we pay an exorbitant fee for the service.  They hint that without this fee, they might be forced to release him."

 dg_succession.016.d:1 "Many questioned the wisdom of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] sharing [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] power with a rival as co-ruler.  However, the two have become like a hand and glove - each complementing the other, able to be where the other cannot, lending their strength when needed.  Such a partnership is a rare and precious thing."

 succession_crisis:1 "Succession Crisis"
 desc_succession_crisis:1 "The nation is divided between two claimants fighting each other for the [Root.GetAdjective] throne."
 succession_problems_obstacle:1 "\nThe traditions of [Root.GetName] meant that no single dynasty could claim a right to the throne.  Instead, there were dozens of precedents for an influential advisor or successful general to take the throne from a weak or untested [Root.Monarch.GetTitle].  Knowing this, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] saw successful leaders as rivals for power and often eliminated them, weakening the state and forcing confrontations such as these.  To end this cycle would require dramatic reforms to society.  (Remove the obstacle by decision)"
 succession_problems_polygamy:1 "\nHaving multiple wives meant never having a problem finding an heir - the problem was having too many.  Since Muslims did not automatically have primogeniture laws, any son could inherit his father's throne.  Some were willing to seize it from a brother if they saw the opportunity, or if they were backed up by an ambitious noble or foreign prince.  In later years, more advanced thinkers proposed drastic measures to avoid this problem: having the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] have all [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] brothers strangled to avoid them rising up against [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]."
 succession_problems_tribal:1 "\nTribes were particularly prone to succession crises, since they did not have clear succession laws.  A strong ruler could secure his rule by gathering support, but a weak one invited rivals to attack.  Only by establishing a state that could enforce the laws in the absence of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] would this end - and that required a complete overhaul of society. (Change your government to avoid this in the future)"
