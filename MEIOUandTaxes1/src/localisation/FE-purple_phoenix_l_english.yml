 Rome.001.t:1 "Lands of the Greeks"
 Rome.001.d:1 "As the empire of a thousand years fades from the world's memory, the time of Rome has come to an end. In its place is a rebirth of the old, the classical, a civilisation risen once more from its ancestoral homeland. The realm of the Hellenes, of Hellas, of Greece has once more returned to the world, a new identity for a new age."

 byzantine_istria_title:1 "§YRegain control of the Adriatic Sea for Rome§!"

 byzantine_greece_title:1 "§YRestore Roman control over Greece§!"
 byzantine_greece_desc:1 "Greece holds a special place in the hearts of all Romans.  Much like Rome itself, however, it would fall long before Constantinople.  Although invaded by Serbs and Bulgars, it would remain in Roman hands until the Fourth Crusade, when it fell into the hands of crusaders.  Their betrayal is still felt keenly, and deserves retribution..."
