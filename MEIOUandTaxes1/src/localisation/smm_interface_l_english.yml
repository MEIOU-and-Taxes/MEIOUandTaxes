 smm_interface_tradebalance_tt:0 "Sets the §YSpecial Mapmode§! (trade goods mapmode in the base game) to display §Rprovincial trade balance§! for the selected good.\n\nThis map shows the overall trade balance of a good in a province. The calculation is:\n\n+ Local Production\n+ Amount Imported\n- Total Demand\n\nThe Total Demand consists of both local demand aswell as demand for exports. The resulting number is the amount the stockpile for this good has increased or diminished since last year.\n\nHaving a negative trade balance a prolonged period of time may lead to a stockpile shortage and thus has a negative impact on a population's needs fulfillment. Traders may attempt to compensate by increasing imports (usually by paying more), thus increasing the price of the good and in turn increasing cost of living for the population.\n\nOn the other hand, a province with a positive trade balance and growing stockpiles will usually enjoy cheaper prices, resulting in more exports and therefore more wealth for both traders and producers of the good in a province. A province also doesn't strictly need high production capabilities to have a positive trade balance. If the province's sector has a high sector score and a good trade network, cheap goods may be sourced abroad, not only to meet the population's demands, but also to re-sell at a premium to other nations that are unable to perform the trade by themselfs.\n\nThis value can fluctuate quite wildly between years, and even if a province has excellent local supply it may temporarily run into a balance deficit if a very good trading opportunity opens up abroad, as the province's traders will try to sell as much as they possibly can when an opportunity to do so arises. In extreme cases they might even sell to a foreign power even though the local population's needs aren't met - if the price is good enough.\n\nYou *could* stop your traders from selling away your population's food by using embargoes, but I thought we are doing a capitalism here!\n\n§TUse the Set Scope menu to change the region wherein values should be compared to each other to get better regional comparisons.§!"    
 smm_interface_deposits_tt:0 "Sets the §YSpecial Mapmode§! (trade goods mapmode in the base game) to display the presence of §Rresource deposits§! for the selected resource.\n\nThis allows you to plan your territorial expansion towards valuable resources like silver or ivory.\n\n§TThis map always uses the worldwide scope.§!"    
 smm_interface_others_sector_tt:0 "Sets the §YSpecial Mapmode§! (trade goods mapmode in the base game) to display §Rtrade sector ranks§!.\n\nSectors with lower rank get to perform all their trade before sectors with higher rank, thus allowing your burghers to buy more goods for cheaper prices and sell more goods for higher prices as they are the first to fill your trade partners' demands.\n\nSector rank is determined by several factors, most importantly trade power (both local and global) and trade efficiency.\n\nYou can check the exact rank of a sector center by hovering over the trade tooltip in the province with the sector center, trade rank is displayed at the very top.\n\nEven a difference of a few ranks will have a large impact on the profitability of your commerce industry, the wealth of your burghers and the prices your population has to pay for goods.\n\nAt the start of the game, it is enough to have a better rank than nations trading within your own trade network, but once the economy starts to globalise, you will need to compete worldwide for rank.\n\n§TUse the Set Scope menu to change the region wherein values should be compared to each other to get better regional comparisons.§!"
 smm_interface_others_pathsandrivers_tt:0 "Sets the §YSpecial Mapmode§! (trade goods mapmode in the base game) to display §Rancient paths or navigable rivers§!.\n\nThis will color provinces belonging to the same path/river route in the same color. Communication efficiency propagates more easily along these routes, and navigable rivers allow for harbourage infrastructure to be constructed (albeit with reduced effect compared to coastal provinces).\n\nA different colored province adjacent to a route usually indicates that this province is connected to the route system, but not to all adjacent provinces that are part of that route system. Likewise, a different colored province between two route systems might be connected to both.\n\nFor rivers, you can usually discern the connections by looking at the rivers on the map and between which provinces they flow. For ancient paths there is currently no good visualisation possible.\n\n§TThis map always uses the worldwide scope.§!"
 smm_interface_others_ce_tt:0 "Sets the §YSpecial Mapmode§! (trade goods mapmode in the base game) to display the §Rcommunication efficiency (CE)§! in your provinces.\n\nCE determines how easily your capital's bureaucracy can exert influence on other provinces, with more remote provinces usually suffering from lower CE.\n\nIt is an important factor heavily influencing local autonomy and therefore how efficiently you can tax and police a province's population.\n\n§TThis map always uses the country scope.§!"
 smm_interface_others_amenities_tt:0 "Sets the §YSpecial Mapmode§! (trade goods mapmode in the base game) to display the §Ramenities surplus§! in your provinces.\n\nIf your urban population outgrows the amenities cap of a province, the death rate of your residents increases due to growing vagrancy, long waiting times for healthcare services, rising crime rate and other undesireable effects.\n\nThis slows down your population growth significantly and should be avoided by building sufficient amenities infrastructure in your cities.\n\n§TThis map always uses the country scope.§!"
 smm_interface_others_migration_tt:0 "Sets the §YSpecial Mapmode§! (trade goods mapmode in the base game) to display the §Rmigration balance§! in provinces.\n\nDepending on economical factors such as quality of life (needs fulfillment), wages and ammenities surplus, people may decide to migrate somewhere else, if allowed to do so.\n\nPeople can migrate between provinces belonging to the same nation and their subjects, but sometimes also internationally. For example, migration within the Holy Roman Empire is always allowed.\n\nThis mapmode shows the net gain or loss of population in a province due to this migration. You should always strife to keep your migration balance positive, as a lack of working age population is a crippling bottleneck for any economy.\n\nOnly teamwork makes the dream work!\n\n§TUse the Set Scope menu to change the region wherein values should be compared to each other to get better regional comparisons.§!"
 smm_interface_others_incomepc_tt:0 "Sets the §YSpecial Mapmode§! (trade goods mapmode in the base game) to display the §Rincome per capita§! in provinces.\n\nThis tells you how well a province's population is doing. Higher income per capita makes a population more wealthy over time, increases their buying power for needs fulfillment and allows them to make investments back into their province's economy, thus accellerating economic growth of the province even further.\n\nA wealthier populace can also be taxed more, either directly via income tax or indirectly through various excises, as the population is buying more taxable goods. Therefore a higher income per capita also increases the funds available to a state through taxation.\n\nImportant to note is that income is not soley based on local wages, but also by income generation through owned properties, corruption and trade value. So a province may have a higher income p.c even with lower wages compared to somewhere else.\n\nThis is what we are all really here for.

 smm_interface_scope_tt:0 "Sets the §Rpreferred scope§! for all maps supporting scope selection.\n\nUsually it is best to use a reduced scope at the start of the game for comparison maps, as you will usually only compete against local nations. Later, as the economy becomes more globalised and you expand to other continents, you might prefer a larger scope. The default scope is Old World."
