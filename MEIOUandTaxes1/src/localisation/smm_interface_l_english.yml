 smm_interface_tradebalance_tt:0 "Sets the §YSpecial Mapmode§! (trade goods mapmode in the base game) to display §Rprovincial trade balance§! for the selected good.\n\nThis map shows the overall trade balance of a good in a province. The calculation is:\n\n+ Local Production\n+ Amount Imported\n- Total Demand\n\nThe Total Demand consists of both local demand aswell as demand for exports. The resulting number is the amount the stockpile for this good has increased or diminished since last year.\n\nHaving a negative trade balance a prolonged period of time may lead to a stockpile shortage and thus has a negative impact on a population's needs fulfillment. Traders may attempt to compensate by increasing imports (usually by paying more), thus increasing the price of the good and in turn increasing cost of living for the population.\n\nOn the other hand, a province with a positive trade balance and growing stockpiles will usually enjoy cheaper prices, resulting in more exports and therefore more wealth for both traders and producers of the good in a province. A province also doesn't strictly need high production capabilities to have a positive trade balance. If the province's sector has a high sector score and a good trade network, cheap goods may be sourced abroad, not only to meet the population's demands, but also to re-sell at a premium to other nations that are unable to perform the trade by themselfs.\n\nThis value can fluctuate quite wildly between years, and even if a province has excellent local supply it may temporarily run into a balance deficit if a very good trading opportunity opens up abroad, as the province's traders will try to sell as much as they possibly can when an opportunity to do so arises. In extreme cases they might even sell to a foreign power even though the local population's needs aren't met - if the price is good enough.\n\nYou *could* stop your traders from selling away your population's food by using embargoes, but I thought we are doing a capitalism here!\n\n§TUse the Set Scope menu to change the region wherein values should be compared to each other to get better regional comparisons.§!"    
 smm_interface_population_rural_tt:0 "Sets the §YSpecial Mapmode§! (trade goods mapmode in the base game) to display the §Rrural population size§! in provinces.\n\nThese are your farmers, miners, fishers and cottage workers. They extract value from the natural resources present in your province. These are usually peasants, which are often beholden to some sort of noble lord or another, and in many cases the nobles receive part of the peasants' wealth as dues, thus improving your peasants' wealth will indirectly strengthen your nobles.\n\nYou can counteract this by increasing peasant freedom and passing reforms which will loosen the nobles' grip on your peasants over time, ensuring their hard earned wealth stays with them rather than being siphoned off to some upstart lordling.\n\nRural population can also come in the form of nomads, usually structured in clans. In areas where these are present they often hold significant power as you will find your state often in need of their manpower in times of war.\n\nThey are rather independent and are difficult to tax, but are also less prone to be exploited by your nobles.\n\n§TUse the Set Scope menu to change the region wherein values should be compared to each other to get better regional comparisons.§!"
 smm_interface_population_urban_tt:0 "Sets the §YSpecial Mapmode§! (trade goods mapmode in the base game) to display the §Rurban population size§! in provinces.\n\nThese are your craftsmen, artisans, spinners, seamstresses, shipwrights, blacksmiths, and generally everyone else working in some sort of industrial capacity.\n\nAs residents of your cities, they are usually required to pay some of their obligations to their city's local elite, like a trade guild, local bankers, landlords, or other upper class city folks (your burghers).\n\nDeveloping a city's industrial properties will drive immigration from the rural surroundings, allowing free peasantry to become residents, but this comes with indirectly strenghtening your burghers. Also, net birth rates in cities are usually much lower than in rural settings, thus over-urbanization can pose a serious threat to the sustainability of your population size at large. Cities also require large amounts of raw materials and food to thrive, which can only be sourced from your rural population, or - given they are rich enough - your burghers via trade.\n\nYou should never forget that your cities need your peasants to survive, but the peasants do not need your cities. Therefore you should keep your rural vs. urban populations well balanced, as all things should be.\n\n§TUse the Set Scope menu to change the region wherein values should be compared to each other to get better regional comparisons.§!"
 smm_interface_population_migration_tt:0 "Sets the §YSpecial Mapmode§! (trade goods mapmode in the base game) to display the §Rmigration balance§! in provinces.\n\nDepending on economical factors such as quality of life (needs fulfillment), wages and amenities surplus, people may decide to migrate somewhere else, if allowed to do so.\n\nPeople can migrate between provinces belonging to the same nation and their subjects, but sometimes also internationally. For example, migration within the Holy Roman Empire is always allowed.\n\nThis mapmode shows the net gain or loss of population in a province due to this migration. You should always strife to keep your migration balance positive, as a lack of working age population is a crippling bottleneck for any economy.\n\nOnly teamwork makes the dream work!\n\n§TUse the Set Scope menu to change the region wherein values should be compared to each other to get better regional comparisons.§!"
 smm_interface_population_amenities_tt:0 "Sets the §YSpecial Mapmode§! (trade goods mapmode in the base game) to display the §Ramenities surplus§! in your provinces.\n\nIf your urban population outgrows the amenities cap of a province, the death rate of your residents increases due to growing vagrancy, long waiting times for healthcare services, rising crime rate and other undesireable effects.\n\nThis slows down your population growth significantly and should be avoided by building sufficient amenities infrastructure in your cities.\n\n§TThis map always uses the country scope.§!"
 smm_interface_population_incomepc_tt:0 "Sets the §YSpecial Mapmode§! (trade goods mapmode in the base game) to display the §Rincome per capita§! in provinces.\n\nThis tells you how well a province's population is currently doing. Higher income per capita makes a population more wealthy over time, increases their buying power for needs fulfillment and allows them to make investments back into their province's economy, thus accelerating economic growth of the province even further.\n\nA wealthier populace can also be taxed more, either directly via income tax or indirectly through various excises, as the population is buying more taxable goods. Therefore a higher income per capita also increases the funds available to a state through taxation.\n\nImportant to note is that income is not soley based on local wages, but also by income generation through owned properties, corruption and trade value. So a province may have a higher income p.c even with lower wages compared to somewhere else.\n\nThis is what we are all really here for.

 smm_interface_population_wealthpc_tt:0 "Sets the §YSpecial Mapmode§! (trade goods mapmode in the base game) to display the §Rwealth per capita§! in provinces.\n\nThis tells you how much cash in the bank a province's population has. Higher wealth per capita makes members of a population class more powerful over time, increases their buying power for needs fulfillment and allows them to make investments back into their province's economy, thus accellerating economic growth of the province even further.\n\nAllthough taxation is usually applied to the current income rather than overall wealth, more cash on hand causes needs fulfilmment to rise even if income temporarily drops, therefore enabling more indirect taxation like excises. Therefore a wealthier populace also increases the funds available to a state through taxation, but be aware that the wealth of your population can shrink over time and saved up wealth does not last forever, as needs fulfillment, property maintenance and other expenses directly reduce wealth if a population does not have net positive income.\n\n§TUse the Set Scope menu to change the region wherein values should be compared to each other to get better regional comparisons.§!"   
 smm_interface_economy_throughput_tt:0 "Sets the §YSpecial Mapmode§! (trade goods mapmode in the base game) to display the §Rrural or urban throughput§! in provinces.\n\nThis shows you how much of the potential capacity of any given resource extraction operation or industrial facility is being utilized.\n\nIf you don't have enough peasants to work your fields, some will lay barren. If you don't have enough fibre for your spinners, not all wheels will spin.\n\nTherefore, throughput will diminish if you lack either workforce or raw materials required to fully utilize a province's properties. More often than not it is lack of workforce rather than lack of materials though. Especially at the very start of the game in and around Europe, you will find most of your properties unable to field enough labor due to the recent depopulation of the continent by the §RBlack Death§!.\n\nLabor shortages drive wages, which in turn does drive immigration. You can use targeted investments, or even overinvestments into your provinces as means to quickly increase your population. Be aware that high wages often cause properties, both rural and urban, to become unprofitable though.\n\nIf those properties are currently in your hand as the state, this will eat directly into your income. Other property owners will simply close down shop, in turn reducing property sizes despite large investments. Thus overinvesting heavily, while a great motor for immigration will usually not result in significant increase in actual property size over time.\n\nIt is therefore best to slowly and steadily spread out your investments, making sure there is always some demand for additional workforce, while also keeping your nation's properties profitable.\n\nOf course, if it's people you are after rather than actually growing your property sizes, you can just go crazy on investments to literally trade money for people. And it doesn't even count as slavery! Great success!\n\n§TThis map always uses the country scope.§!"

Communication efficiency propagates more easily along these routes, and navigable rivers allow for harbourage infrastructure to be constructed (albeit with reduced effect compared to coastal provinces).\n\nA different colored province adjacent to a route usually indicates that this province is connected to the route system, but not to all adjacent provinces that are part of that route system. Likewise, a different colored province between two route systems might be connected to both.\n\nFor rivers, you can usually discern the connections by looking at the rivers on the map and between which provinces they flow.

 smm_interface_others_power_tt:0 "Sets the §YSpecial Mapmode§! (trade goods mapmode in the base game) to display the §Relite power§! of the selected estate in provinces.\n\nElite Power represents the overall sway an elite holds over your country, your population, and you. Powerful elites should be kept somewhat happy, lest you run the risk of triggering a catastrophic civil war, which you will be hard pressed to win as large swathes of your country turn against tyranical rule.\n\nPower is both derived from various reforms or laws you can pass, but often also by the sheer wealth of your elites. Over time, it is advisable to limit both of those, by passing reforms that curb the power of your elites and by land reforms, expropriating property and land to reduce your elite's powerbase. This is a slow process that should not be rushed.\n\nWhen conquering new land, you cannot simply ignore the local elites as you will need them to administer your newly integrated territories. Thus, you may want to consider the local powerbroker's makeup before expanding into neighbouring territory, as a large shift in power due to an influx of new lords, bankers or even clergymen can sometimes be more destabilizing then dealing with the rest of the local population.\n\n§TUse the Set Scope menu to change the region wherein values should be compared to each other to get better regional comparisons.§!"

Adverserial actions like limiting an elite's power, passing unpopular reforms or appropriating land and property from them have a negative effect on their loyalty, wheras strenghtening their position, aligning the cabinet with their interests and other boons or bribes increases it.\n\nKeeping your elites happy will increase their cooperation when it comes to matters of taxation. They will also be willing to give you a larger share of their levies, or go the extra mile for some volunteers recruitment, thus increasing your manpower pool. Happy elites are also less prone to corruption.\n\nKeep in mind that oftentimes, the local lords and lordlings pay little mind to who currently sits on their country's throne, so when conquering new land you will have to proof through deeds that you are indeed a more amenable ruler than whoever's land you just usurped, and very unhappy local elites who were already plotting against their old liege may still hold onto their plans of insurrection, just in case you don't turn out to be any better.\n\n§TUse the Set Scope menu to change the region wherein values should be compared to each other to get better regional comparisons.§!"
 smm_interface_others_state_reach_tt:0 "Sets the §YSpecial Mapmode§!

Some nationwide reforms can only be attempted if the average state reach of all provinces is at a certain level, as otherwise simply no one will care what nonsense the monarch just sputtered.\n\nThis is especially true for newly conquered territories, where you might find the local government infrastructure sorely lacking and unable to project your will in a satisfying manner.

 smm_interface_others_corruption_tt:0 "Sets the §YSpecial Mapmode§! (trade goods mapmode in the base game) to display the §Rprovincial corruption§! of provinces.\n\nAs power starts to slowly shift from the traditional powerholders of the realm towards appointed or elected buerocrats, some of the man suddenly burdened with power and responsibility might find their wages unsatisfactory, their work requirements intolerable or the local laws counter to their personal feelings.\n\nThis, sadly, causes such individuals to sometimes come to the conclusion, that laws are really more like guidelines, and even the strictest regulations mere suggestions... for a price.\n\nThis raises local corruption, reducing the efficiency of tax farming, aswell as also strongly contributing to the overall corruption of the realm, which in turn further fuels provincial corruption in an escalating spiral of degeneracy. As this drastically undermines the authority of the state and leads to severe loss of income, such excesses must be counteracted by any means necessary, using both carrot and stick.\n\nReforms that increase government wages will certainly help, but so will a few well timed executions, colloquially also known as "recalling" corrupt officials. If you are on good terms with your elites, they might help you out every once in a while too with cutting out the rot, and as a large portion of your buerocrats are often less significant members of noble or otherwise powerful families, keeping your elites happy often prevents an individual to bring shame on themself and by extension their family to begin with.\n\n§TUse the Set Scope menu to change the region wherein values should be compared to each other to get better regional comparisons.§!"
