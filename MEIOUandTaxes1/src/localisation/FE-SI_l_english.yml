If we want to survive, we must be ready to face any possible threat. We will study the deeds of the great generals of the past, and read about the accomplishments of our ancestors, for the margraves of Montferrat were seldom at peace, and they were quite successful at what they did."

 rim_tempio_malatestiano_desc:1 "The Malatesta Temple is the cathedral church of Rimini. Officially named for St. Francis, it takes the popular name from Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta, who commissioned its reconstruction by the famous Renaissance theorist and architect Leon Battista Alberti around 1450. Due to the strong presence of elements referring to the Malatesta's history, and to Sigismondo Pandolfo himself (in particular, his lover Isotta), the church was considered by some contemporaries to be an exaltation of Paganism, but also an allegory on the new art of the Renaissance."

The style is recognisable not only for its typical Baroque curves and flourishes, but also by its grinning masks and putti and a particular flamboyance that has given Sicily a unique architectural identity. The highly decorative Sicilian Baroque period lasted barely fifty years, and perfectly reflected the social order of the island at a time when, nominally ruled by Spain, it was in fact governed by a wealthy and often extravagant aristocracy into whose hands ownership of the primarily agricultural economy was highly concentrated. Its Baroque architecture gives the island an architectural character that has lasted into the twenty first century."

 PISAN_INSURRECTION_DESC:1 "In the chaos of the First Italian War, Pisa was able to regain its independence after decades under Florentine rule. Florence, which suffered under the diplomatic and militaristic changes in Italy, was paralysed for over a year. Pisa's walls proved to be strong, and the brave Pisans defended their new freedom with their bare hands and bones. The struggle continued for nearly 15 years, in which Pisa was supported by foreign powers like Venice and Milan. Nevertheless, the resources of Florence were much greater. Can Pisa preserve its newly achieved freedom?"

 PASQUE_VERONESI_DESC:1 "In 1796, Napoleon conquered the Venetian provinces of Bergamo, Brescia and Verona. Venice did nothing against it, hoping to resolve the revolutionary conflict diplomatically, and declaring itself neutral in the War of the First Coalition. The Veronese, suffering under French occupation, rose up on Easter: This was the 'Pasque Veronesi', a large revolt of the people of Verona, but also other cities in the region of Lake Garda. Days later, Napoleon declared war upon Venice, announcing that he would be an 'Attila' for the Serenissima. Can the little republic of Saint Mark resist the mightiest army in the world?"

Beside inter-Italian struggles, each of these states had internal affairs to solve. In Florence, the Medici dynasty tries to establish their rule by supporting the Renaissance and gaining the favour of the different social factions. Venice with its unique system tries to keep a balance in its government. Besides those powers, there are other interesting choices like Siena with its Palio, or the City of Cologne, which still dreams of finishing the cathedral. Or maybe you want to relax? Play a game of Jeu de Paume, revel in the Carnival or enjoy the Opera! By the way, shouldn't you modernise your out-of-fashion capital a bit...?"

The Turks and the pirates were making dangerous inroads on the coast of the Tyrrhenian Sea. The Grand Duke needed a symbolic conflict to unite the nobility of the different cities that combined to form his new grand duchy (including Florence and Siena), and to demonstrate his support of the Roman Catholic Church. Finally, the creation of a Tuscan military order would also strengthen the prestige, both internal and international, of Cosimo's new state."

It has the form of a Latin cross with a slightly projecting transept, a dome, and a bell tower. The origins of the first structure are obscure and shrouded in legend. There was a ninth century church with bishop's palace at the present location. In 1196, the cathedral masons' guild, the Opera di Santa Maria, was put in charge of the construction of a new cathedral. Works were started with the north-south transept and it was planned to add the main, larger body of the cathedral later, but this enlargement was never accomplished. By 1215 daily masses were already being said in the new church. A second massive addition of the main body of the cathedral was planned in 1339. It would have more than doubled the size of the structure by means of an entirely new nave and two aisles ranged perpendicular to the existing nave and centred on the high altar. The construction was begun under the direction of Giovanni di Agostino, better known as a sculptor. Construction was halted by the Black Death in 1348. Basic errors in the construction were already evident by then, however, and the work was never resumed. The outer walls remain of this extension, and can now be seen to the south of the Duomo - a sign of Sienese ambition, but also failure. The Duomo has become the symbol of the decline of our city. Should Siena never rise again?"

Although once widely played, the cradle of the sport is now considered to be the Piazza Santa Croce in Florence. Here it became known as the giuoco del calcio Fiorentino ('Florentine kick game') or simply calcio; which is now also the name for football in the Italian language. The game may have started as a revival of the Roman sport of harpastum. Calcio was reserved for rich aristocrats who played every night between Epiphany and Lent. Even Popes, such as Clement VII, Leo XI and Urban VIII were known to play the sport in the Vatican City. The games were known to get violent as teams vied with each other to score goals. In 1574 Henry III of France attended a game of 'bridge fighting', put on in his honour during a visit to Venice; the king is recorded as saying: 'Too small to be a real war and too cruel to be a game'. It was also known as the favourite sport of many Italian Princes, who sought to exercise their bodies."

 organise_jeu_de_paume_title:1 "Organise a match of Jeu de Paume in $CAPITAL_CITY$"
 organise_jeu_de_paume_desc:1 "Jeu de paume (English: 'palm game') is a ball-and-court game that originated in France. It had some similarities with palla, fives, pelota, and handball, involving hitting a ball with a bare hand and later with a glove. One theory is that this game was played by monks in monastery cloisters, based on the construction and appearance of early courts, some of which were grass fields. By the sixteenth century, the glove had become a racquet, the game had moved to an enclosed playing area, and the rules had stabilised. Real tennis spread in popularity throughout royalty in Europe, reaching its peak in the sixteenth century. Francis I of France (1515-47) was an enthusiastic player and promoter of real tennis, building courts and encouraging play among courtiers and commoners. His successor Henry II (1547-59) was also an excellent player and continued the royal French tradition. In 1555 an Italian priest, Antonio Scaino da Salothe, wrote the first known book about tennis (Trattato del Giuco della Palla). Two French kings died from tennis-related episodes - Louis X of a severe chill after playing and Charles VIII after hitting his head during a game. King Charles IX granted a constitution to the Corporation of Tennis Professionals in 1571, creating the first pro tennis 'tour'. Royal interest in England began with Henry V (1413-22). Henry VIII (1509-47) made the biggest impact as a young monarch; playing the game with gusto at Hampton Court on a court he built in 1530. It is believed that his second wife Anne Boleyn was watching a game when she was arrested and that Henry was playing when news of her execution arrived. During the reign of James I (1603-25), London had 14 courts."

The works in it were compiled during a time span of around 40 years, from the mid-1470s until the beginning of the sixteenth century. The manuscript contains 458 works, the bulk of which are in Castilian, although a few works also appear in Latin, French, Catalan and Portuguese. It constitutes an anthology of the polyphonic music performed during the reign of the Catholic Monarchs. The themes found in the songs are the most varied: romantic, religious, festive, chivalrous, satirical, pastoral, burlesque, political, historical, etc., accompanied by music of all styles, from popular folk songs to elaborate compositions. The most important musical form is the villancico, though other genres are also found, such as the romance and the canción. The majority of the works are for one voice with instrumental accompaniment but polyphonic works are also available for two, three or four voices. Famous composers like Juan de Encina, Luis de Milán or Pedro de Escobar contributed pieces to this compilation. Some villancicos, like 'Rodrigo Martinez' are also mentioned in this fine example of Iberian high culture."

Traditionally during Lent, no parties or other celebrations were held, and people refrained from eating rich foods, such as meat, dairy, fats and sugar. While medieval pageants and festivals such as Corpus Christi were church-sanctioned celebrations, carnival was also a manifestation of medieval folk culture. Some of the best-known traditions, including carnival parades and masquerade ball masquerading, were first recorded in medieval Italy. The carnival of Venice was for a long time the most famous carnival. From Italy, it spread to other parts of Europe. Carnival traditions developed especially in central Europe, along the rivers Rhine and Main, with centres in Southern Germany, the Rhineland and Burgundy."

 Serenissima_information:1 "Most Serene Republic of Saint Mark"
 desc_Serenissima_information:1 "This form of government consists of several institutions, forming a complicated web. The most important are the Maggior Consiglio (Great Council), the Consiglio dei Pregadi (Senate), the Consiglio dei X (Council of Ten) and the Doge (head of state). As long as they stay in harmony, the Venetian system will be beneficial for our country. The power of one institution is defined by powerpoints, which determine the power-level of one institution. A weak institution has 0-14 points, an influential one has 15-29 points, a strong one 30-44 points, and a dominant one has more than 45 points. If the balance should be disturbed, the patricians will try to counter the menace. This especially applies for an ambitious Doge, who may seek to change the political landscape in his favour. Changes will take a long time, and will only occur during the day-to-day business of the state, as the competences of the different councils tend to overlap. Low republican tradition and an unbalanced system make such struggles more common."

 venetian_republic.EVTNAME0:1 "La Serenissima"
 venetian_republic.EVTDESC0:1 "In 1297, with the so-called Serrata, the membership in the Great Council of Venice (Maggior Consiglio) became hereditary. The Maggior Consiglio was the basic institution of the Republic of Venice in which every patrician had a seat and could participate in political life. As it grew further (with around 2000 members in the sixteenth century), other institutions had to be elected by the members of the Maggior Consiglio to keep the Serenissima governable. At the end of the fourteenth century Venice had a vast amount of different councils, forming a net of complex institutions with overlapping competencies: the Avogardori del comun, the Quarantia, the Consiglio dei Pregadi (Senate), the Collegio dei Savi, the Consiglio dei X (Council of Ten) and the Procuratori di San Marco are only some names to give an idea. The most important rule in this kind of government was the prevention of a monarchy. Powerful offices, like a seat in the Consiglio dei X, had only a short tenure and members couldn't be elected for successive terms. The Consiglio dei X became the most important office in the fourteenth century, as it was intended to preserve the government from overthrow. Unfortunately, councils with the ability to determine high treason tend to become overpowered authorities. In the fifteenth century, the 'Ten' were able to gain control in financial, military and judicial areas, becoming the strongest institution in Venice. The Senate, on the other side, consisted of members who stayed in office and tried to keep the Council of Ten in check, having lost some traditional competencies to that organisation. Last but not least, there is still the Doge, the face of the Serenissima herself. Before the eleventh century, he ruled Venice like a monarch, then becoming the 'first slave' of the Republic. It's not the first time that an institution changed its face, and it won't be the last time. Venice is a harmonic organism. Tipping the balance is possible... but the patricians will keep their republican ideals, making Venice an exceptional governmental body, not only in Italy, but in the whole world."

And to our Lord $MONARCH$, by the grace of God, illustrious Doge of Venice, Dalmatia, and Croatia, and lord of the fourth part and a half of the Empire of Romania, be safety, honour, long life, and victory!

A current debate concerning trade policies ended in a struggle between different merchant groups with their own interests. As this discussion goes on, the Maggior Consiglio is blocked and not able to find a proper solution. Some countrymen suggest that other councils should solve that problem.

The term Barnabotti refers to those patricians who, despite having lost much of their fortune, continued by law to maintain their seat in the Great Council of Venice, the assembly that governed the Venetian city and state. Although they maintained a position of political influence, due to their impoverishment the Barnabotti as a group were frequently involved in disputes with the rest of the nobility.

All male citizens had been expected to practise with the crossbow since the thirteenth century. The main purpose of this training was to provide bowmen to defend the galleys. The gradual decline of the relative utility of the crossbow in the fifteenth century contributed to a lessening in the enthusiasm for this training. It was noted in the Senate that the posts of noble bowman on the galleys (four were nominated to each galley) were being monopolised by a small number of men who were the only ones who bothered to keep up the training. This was seen as being not only damaging to the defensive capabilities of the city's population, but also a dangerously oligarchical sociopolitical trend, as the post of the noble archer was regarded as one of the first rungs on the ladder of a political career.

The city had - like other Lombard dominions - privileges in the Terraferma and felt much better under the Venetian government than under the more direct Visconti rule.

The project was approved by Domenico Cerato, professor of architecture at Vicenza and Padova. Today there are 78 statues (40 in the exterior ring and 38 statues in the inner ring), following the original plan there had been 88 statues.

 venetian_republic.EVTDESC75:1 "Francesco Scipione, marchese di Maffei, was an Italian writer and art critic, author of many articles and plays. An antiquarian with a humanist education whose publications on Etruscan antiquities stand as incunabula of Etruscology, he engaged in running skirmishes in print with his rival in the field of antiquities, Antonio Francesco Gori. In 1710, he spent some time studying the manuscripts in the Royal Library at Turin; while there he arranged the collection of objects of art which the late Carlo Emanuele, Duke of Savoy had brought from Rome. From 1718 he became especially interested in the archaeology of his native town, and his investigations resulted in the valuable Verona illustrata (1731–1732). Maffei devoted the years 1732-1736 to travel in France, England, the Netherlands and Germany. On his return to Verona, he built a museum, which he bequeathed, together with his valuable archaeological and artistic collection, to his native city. He bequeathed his collection of manuscripts to the canons of the cathedral of Verona."

 venetian_republic.EVTDESC76:1 "Aldus Pius Manutius was born in Bassiano, in the Papal States. His family was well off and Manutius was educated as a humanistic scholar. In 1482 he went to reside at Mirandola with his old friend and fellow student, the illustrious Giovanni Pico. There he stayed two years, pursuing his studies in Greek literature. Before Pico moved to Florence, he procured for Manutius the post of tutor to his nephews, Alberto and Lionello Pio, princes of Carpi. Alberto Pio supplied Manutius with funds for starting his printing press. The leading publisher and printer of the Venetian High Renaissance, Aldus set up a definite scheme of book design, produced the first italic type, introduced small and handy pocket editions (octavos) of the classics, and applied several innovations in binding technique and design for use on a broad scheme. He commissioned Francesco Griffo to cut a slanted type known today as italic. In 1501, Aldus began to use, as his publisher's device, the image of a dolphin wrapped around an anchor. His editions of the classics were so highly respected that the dolphin-and-anchor device was almost immediately pirated by French and Italian publishers. The dolphin and anchor emblem is associated with 'Festina lente' (Hasten slowly), a motto that Aldus had begun to use as early as 1499, after receiving a Roman coin from Pietro Bembo, which bore the emblem and motto. Manutius desired to preserve ancient Greek literature by printing editions of its greatest books. He introduced personal or pocket editions of the classics in Greek and Latin that all could own. Scholars admired his editions and the work that he undertook to edit these ancient texts. Manutius is also believed to have been the first typographer to use a semicolon."

Besides these charitable aspects, they were also convents and music schools. Children with a good voice became singers; the others had to learn an instrument. This way, Venice solved this social problem and also had a neverending source of musicians for its festivities. Each Hospital had an orchestra of at least thirty to forty elements, all females (La Pietà's orchestra counted up to sixty) and competed with each other by hiring the best musicians in the city, promoting high quality concerts, and through such activities provided countless commissions for violin and other instruments makers to provide for the maintenance and repair of such instruments. Much of Vivaldi's sacred vocal and instrumental music was written for performance at the Ospedale della Pietà, which produced many virtuosos and at least two composers: Anna Bon and Vincenta Da Ponte."

In contrary to these times, the gondolas of the sixteenth century were still coloured and had no standard style. There were red, blue, even golden gondolas. The patricians liked to show what they had, and a luxury gondola became a symbol of influence and power. However, there were different opinions about the matter. In the second half of the sixteenth century, a group of so-called 'moralists' claimed that this development was also a symbol of vanity and extravagance. Others said that this 'inordinate expenditures' could have been spent elsewhere. The Serenissima had to debate over a new sumptuary law."

 venetian_republic.EVTDESC79:1 "Il Ridotto was the site of the West's first public, legal mercantile casino. The term 'ridotto' comes from the Italian word 'ridurre,' meaning to 'close off' or 'make private'. It originally referred to several illegal, privately owned gambling clubs that offered games of chance to members of Venice's nobility in the city's Rialto District. These clubs came into being after the Venetian authorities attempted to ban games of chance that had spontaneously sprung up in the city's streets. Realising it could not effectively prevent citizens from wagering on dice and card games, the Great Council of Venice opened its 'Ridotto' in 1638 on the occasion of the city's annual Spring Carnival. As for games, Il Ridotto is known to have offered biribi and basetta. Biribi was a lottery-like game in which players placed bets on one of 70 possible outcomes. A casino employee, the 'banker', would then draw a number from a bag, and anyone who had bet on that number would win the game's pot. The most popular game at Il Ridotto, however, was basetta. This game was a cross between blackjack, poker and gin rummy and offered winning players 60 times their wages in payout. In later years it was replaced by faro."

 venetian_republic.EVTDESC82:1 "Carlo Osvaldo Goldoni was an Italian playwright and librettist from the Republic of Venice. His works include some of Italy's most famous and best-loved plays. Audiences have admired the plays of Goldoni for their ingenious mix of wit and honesty. His plays offered his contemporaries images of themselves, often dramatizing the lives, values, and conflicts of the emerging middle classes. Though he wrote in French and Italian, his plays make rich use of the Venetian language, regional vernacular, and colloquialisms. Goldoni, a prolific writer, is best known for his comic play 'Servant of Two Masters', which has been translated and adapted internationally numerous times. After 1748, Goldoni collaborated with the composer Baldassare Galuppi, making significant contributions to the new form of 'opera buffa'. Galuppi composed the score for more than twenty of Goldoni's librettos. As with his comedies, Goldoni's opera buffa integrated elements of the Commedia dell'arte with recognisable local and middle-class realities. In his 'Memoirs' Goldoni amply discusses the state of Italian comedy when he began writing. At that time, Italian comedy revolved around the conventionality of the Commedia dell'arte, or improvised comedy. Goldoni took to himself the task of superseding the comedy of masks and the comedy of intrigue by representations of actual life and manners. He rightly maintained that Italian life and manners were susceptible of artistic treatment such as had not been given them before."

In fact, he travelled a lot through Europe on his 'Grand Tour', meeting other philosophers and even high-ranking nobles. However, our spies... well, posted scouts informed the Dieci that this man is an immoral, maybe dangerous subject. He has connections to the society of Freemasonry and seems to be an expert in the obscure field of cabalism. We are also informed about a library of forbidden books, including satanic writings and other materials.

The Maggior Consiglio was a congress of merchantmen who desired to gain benefits for their trade. The conquest of Brescia and Verona - historically happened at the beginning of the fifteenth century - was done to secure economic and trade interests after the War of Chioggia, when Venice faced severe problems without a safe hinterland. Land expansion was seen as a serious threat to the traditional interests in Mediterranean trade and was viewed sceptical by notable patricians. Every expansion beyond the coast had an impact on the republican tradition of the Serenissima, which relied on trade, ships and a mighty armada, not on fortresses and armies. A new administration for our mainland provinces would lead to a better integration of these provinces and encourage the nobility to participate in the 'Terraferma' affairs."

Before leaving, the Doge boarded the ceremonial galley, the Bucintoro, and set out to sea along the San Nicolò di Lido canal, while the Bishop of Venice gave his blessing to the Adriatic. Having reached the mouth of the harbour, the Doge then threw a golden ring into the sea to symbolically marry Venice to the sea and demonstrate the Serenissima's domination of the gulf. The Sensa was one of the most splendid festivals in Italy, known through Europe, and as prestigious as it was costly."

The first expansion will increase our current benefits, and lower our costs regarding lightships."

 festa_sensa.EVTDESC0:1 "The 'Marriage of the Adriatic', or more correctly 'Marriage of the Sea' (in Italian, Sposalizio del Mare), was a ceremony symbolizing the maritime dominion of Venice. The ceremony, established about 1000 to commemorate the Doge Pietro II Orseolo's conquest of Dalmatia, was originally one of supplication and placation, Ascension Day being chosen as the day on which the Doge set out on his expedition. The form it took was a solemn procession of boats, headed by the Doge's nave (ship), from 1311 the Bucentaur, out to sea by the Lido port. A prayer was offered that 'for us and all who sail thereon the sea may be calm and quiet', whereupon the doge and the others were solemnly anointed with holy water, the rest of which was thrown into the sea while the priests chanted 'Asperges me hyssopo, et mundabor' ('Sprinkle me with hyssop, and I will be clean' - Psalm 51:7). To this ancient ceremony a quasi-sacramental character was given by Pope Alexander III in 1177, in return for the services rendered by Venice in the struggle against the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I. The pope drew a ring from his finger and, giving it to the doge, bade him cast such a one into the sea each year on Ascension Day, and so wed the sea. Henceforth the ceremonial, instead of placatory and expiatory, became nuptial. Every year the doge dropped a consecrated ring into the sea, and with the Latin words 'Desponsamus te, mare, in signum veri perpetuique domini' ('We wed thee, sea, in the sign of the true and everlasting Lord') declared Venice and the sea to be indissolubly one."

 medici_system_information:1 "The Medici system"
 desc_medici_system_information:1 "Different classes represent the society of Florence: the Merchants (mercanti), the Artisans (artigiani) and the common People (popolo). The Medici were able to establish their rule over the city because they acted as the godfathers of the people. Have you a problem? Good old Cosimo will solve it for you! That was the base of the Medici power in the republic, which was only possible with the wealth of the famous Medici bank. There exist four different phases of favour: ignored (0-3 favour points), known (4-6 favour points), esteemed (7-9) and loved (10 or more favour points). Showing your greatness, enacting decisions, events and the election of a Gonfaloniere may change the favour points. If the Medici are able to enact the most important decisions and gain the favour of all classes ('loved'), then they may abolish the office of the Gonfaloniere. If they do so, the successor of the current Medici will become the first Signore of Florence, establishing the dynasty for future generations. If Cosimo dies before he does that, his son Piero may follow; after Piero follows Lorenzo. But if Lorenzo is not able to establish the Medici rule forever, the Florentine republic will return to a normal one, with elected Gonfalioneri, and without the benefits of the Medici system. One further note... gaining favour costs money. Founding new banks will push your income!"

 medici_system.EVTNAME0:1 "The Grey Eminence of Florence"
 medici_system.EVTDESC0:1 "The House of Medici was a political dynasty and banking family that first began to gather prominence under Cosimo de' Medici in the Republic of Florence during the late fourteenth century. The family originated in the Mugello region of the Tuscan countryside, gradually rising until they were able to found the Medici Bank. The bank was the largest in Europe during the fifteenth century, seeing the Medici gain political power in Florence - though officially they remained citizens rather than monarchs. Their wealth and influence initially derived from the textile trade guided by the guild of the Arte della Lana. Like other signore families they dominated their city's government, they were able to bring Florence under their family's power, allowing for an environment where art and humanism could flourish. They fostered and inspired the birth of the Italian Renaissance along with other families of Italy, such as the Visconti and Sforza of Milan, the Este of Ferrara, and the Gonzaga of Mantua. The Medici Bank was one of the most prosperous and most respected institutions in Europe. There are some estimates that the Medici family were the wealthiest family in Europe for a period of time. From this base, they acquired political power initially in Florence and later in wider Italy and Europe. In 1433 Cosimo's power over Florence, which he exerted without occupying public office, began to look like a menace to the anti-Medici party, led by figures such as Palla Strozzi and Rinaldo degli Albizzi: in September of that year he was imprisoned, accused of the failure of the conquest of Lucca, but he managed to turn the jail term into one of exile. He went to Padua and then to Venice, taking his bank along with him. A year later, when the rivals of the Medici - the house of Albizzi - lost their power in Florence, Cosimo de' Medici returned and gained full control over the republic. Cosimo's time in exile instilled in him the need to squash the factionalism that resulted in his exile in the first place. In order to do this, Cosimo, with the help of favourable priors in the Signoria, instigated a series of constitutional changes to secure his power through influence. It would be the beginning of the 'hidden Signoria' of Florence, in which the Medici seek to install their dynasty forever."

 medici_system.EVTNAME1:1 "The Death of Cosimo de' Medici"
 medici_system.EVTDESC1:1 "Cosimo de' Medici was the first 'de facto' ruler of Florence. Born on 27 September 1389, he was the son of Giovanni di Bicci de Medici, the founder of the Banco Medici. He followed his father's steps since a young age, working alongside him and becoming a banker. In 1415 Cosimo became an ambassador for the city of Florence, he travelled across the peninsula and made his first steps in politics. Following the death of his father in 1429 he inherited a vast wealth which he immediately put to use. While Giovanni was first and foremost a banker, Cosimo saw in the meddling with Florentine politics the next natural step in his career. His rise was fast and impressive. Cosimo never held any public office except the position of Gonfaloniere di giustizia, preferring instead to pull the strings of his men, put into key positions. By 1433 his influence was so big that it was bound to cause jealousy and resentment among the old aristocratic families of Florence. Blaming him for the failure of the campaign against the city of Lucca, Palla Strozzi and Rinaldo degli Abizzi managed to cause his imprisonment. Cosimo was accused of being a 'magnate', a tyrant. He managed to oil the cogwheels in the right places, though, and the sentence was commuted to exile, the first exile of the Medici. Cosimo went to Venice, where he was treated like a monarch in official visit. From there he planned his return, and in less than a year he was back. He made a triumphal return in 1434, acclaimed by the people. While his power in Florence was absolute, he was always formally respectful of the republican tradition of the city. Reputed by most a just ruler, he knew how to rule with an iron fist in times of necessity, and when Bernando d'Anghiari, one of his opposition, was thrown from a tower and killed, he said that 'While an enemy who falls from a tower isn't exactly helpful, on the other hand he also cannot harm anyone anymore.'\nCosimo the Elder died in $YEAR$. Cosimo left a vast financial empire and an even larger network of political connections to his son Piero, known as the 'gouty', whom under many aspects was far less successful than his father, had to face a renewed internal opposition to the Medici rule."

When his father Cosimo was still alive and running the Banco Medici, he never participated in the family business, preferring instead to focus on his humanist studies and on his interests in literature. When Cosimo the Elder died, Piero succeeded to the lead of the Banco Medici. The transition wasn't easy: as first measure, Piero decided to recall a number of loans to many supporters of the Medici. That caused many bankruptcies and the Medici lost many political allies. Piero had then to face a renewed and bigger opposition, and it didn't take long for those who hated the Medici to act against him. Piero's reign on Florence was troubled by political opposition, but he managed to survive it and to continue the policy of supporting the arts that was his father Cosimo. In $YEAR$, following Piero's death, the Banco Medici was inherited by his clever and competent son Lorenzo, who would later become known as Lorenzo the Magnificent. Lorenzo, groomed for power since his birth, skilled jouster, hunter, horse breeder, art patron and poet, was the epitome of the Renaissance prince, but who knows what sort of threat might be hidden for him? The rival families haven't forgotten what Florence was before the Medici took the power for themselves, and would return to those times if they could (or to simply replace the Medici with themselves.) They are only waiting for the right time to strike."

What we know is that Lorenzo has no heir, and the dominion of the Medici over Florence seems over. Important characters and families of the town are already negotiating the transition. Although some would like to become the new Signori of the town, no one has even half of the strength the Medici had. Most are calling for a restoration of the Republic. A new Gonfaloniere is being elected, and the people of Florence vow that no one will rule over their city like a king. Will it be so? The Medici showed the world that it is possible to ascend to absolute power with enough cunning, and more than a few would like to follow their example. In the meanwhile, dark clouds gather on the horizon as more and more citizens listen to the words of the zealous Savonarola, whose flaming sermons are a violent accuse towards the bankers, enemies of God, and the Pope."

It will have a positive effect on our economy, and it will strengthen our relation with Florence. Branches of the Banco Medici were de facto independent from the main Medici Bank in Florence. Its legal structure resembled that of a modern holding company. Florence owned the lion's share of shares in each branch, but there would also be independent partnerships. The branch manager, or governor, would be picked among the partners, and he would receive a bigger share of the dividends, which were distributed to the shareholders each year on 24 March, after a thorough examination of the books. The first branch was opened in Rome contemporarily to the founding of the Banco Medici proper, in 1397, under Giovanni di Bicci de' Medici. Five years later, in 1402, a new branch was opened in Venice, which was the first branch to start the practise to reward the general manager with shares of the branch rather than with a salary. While the Medici built factories for the production of woolen cloth, the Rome branch of the Banco Medici opened a branch in Naples (closed in 1425 and replaced with one in Geneva) and Gaeta. When Giovanni died in 1429 the bank was wealthy, numbering 180,000 gold florins in value. The transition to Cosimo was smooth, and under him the Banco Medici flourished and became the wealthiest bank in Europe. More branches were later opened in Bruges, Pisa, Lyons, London, Avignon and Milan. Those branches would then invest in a number of activities to increase its dividends, such as production of textiles and mining. The florin had become, by then, the international value of Europe, and Medici would loan money to many monarchs and kings. The Medici became the wealthiest family in Europe thanks to this complex web of investments."

 medici_system.EVTDESC6:1 "When war erupted suddenly between us and the Florentine dogs, we knew we'd have to act quickly. As soon as the dawn broke, our troops were surrounding the Banco Medici in $CAPITAL_CITY$. After two hours of siege the Florentines refused to surrender the gold, and we had to storm the building. The fight was quick, but not bloodless, and there were casualties on each side. Our troops immediately walked to the vault, forced a clerk to open it... and to the horror of everyone, found it empty. The Florentines must have used those hours to slip the gold out through a secret passage.\n 'They cannot be far', said the captain of the guards. 'Quickly, dispatch patrols: I want every inch of the town and the surrounding countryside searched.' In the afternoon, ten miles from $CAPITAL_CITY$, in a small patch of woods, a group of soldiers stopped a waggon carrying, allegedly, sacks of flours. The two merchants were extremely nervous, and that suspected the soldiers. When it became clear that the guards would have checked the sacks and opened them, the two men reached for crossbows and daggers hidden under their clothes. They shot one of our men, and tried to make a run for it. To no avail. They got caught shortly after their attempt, and one is now in jail, while the second died of his wounds.\n Later the waggon was escorted back to the city. It must have been a peculiar sight for the commoners; fifty armed soldiers on horses escorting a single cart. What might it contain? They will never know the truth. $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ knew though, and he smiled as he heard from his guards that a small fortune in florins of the Banco Medici was being brought to the cellar of his palace."

In the good old times of the Comune, back in the twelfth century, when happy little Italians could have their fights without the intervention of megalomaniac strangers who wanted to take plunder or base tax, there were two famous alliances: Florence, Genoa and Lucca on one side, Pisa and Siena on the other. Pisa was beaten by the Genoese on water at the end of the thirteenth century, and later on land by the Florentines. From the eleventh to thirteenth century, the great merchant city - the most important of central Italy - lost its power, its glory, its greatness. Old families like the Alliata, the della Gherardesca, the Roncioni and the Caetani have moved to foreign lands. The city has lost size. Everything is in decay. The hard rulership of Florentine governors, who wanted to smash every rebellion, are responsible for this. Pisa lays at the mouth of the Arno River, which connects Florence with the Sea and worldwide commerce. Without the control of Pisa, Florence can't flourish. So, the treatment became harder, and Pisa suffered more. But in the last months, in the last weeks, something changed. Conspiracies, some say. Paranoia, others replied. There seems to be a strong movement which wants to free Pisa again. Maybe we should give autonomy to prevent the worst."

 medici_system.EVTDESC38:1 "Alessandro di Mariano di Vanni Filipepi, better known as Botticelli, was born in Florence in 1445, and is hailed as one of the most influential and talented painters of the Renaissance. His was the Golden Age of arts in Florence, under the patronage of Lorenzo il Magnifico. Among his works are the Primavera, the Adoration of the Magi, the well-known Birth of Venus, and an illustrated edition of Dante's Inferno. Avid reader, passionate student of the Ancients' culture, with a restless mind and a troubled soul, Botticelli exemplifies the character of early humanists, the continuation in spirit of people like Roger Bacon, Petrarch or Salutati, in league with contemporary polymaths and scholars like Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo or Bessarion, and that would give way to the Enlightenment of Voltaire, Rousseau or Lavoisier.\nIn later years, something was stirring in the depths of his soul, some kind of void that only Savonarola's preaching could fill. In full repentance, he quit painting for a while, and the few paintings he did from then on was almost always of religious theme, and his style changed gradually into mystical, exaggerate expressiveness. During his time in the Piagnone company, he was accused of sodomy and of 'keeping a boy'. Unsatisfied and bitter, he continued on without much notoriety, and died alone and penniless.\nHis fame was eclipsed by the new generation of great artists (this may be why there's no Ninja Turtle called Botticelli), and it wasn't until the nineteenth century that he was vindicated as one of the most important artists of his time."

A man of great passion, hothead temperament and immense charisma, he met and impressed both Lorenzo the Magnificent and Marsilio Ficino, turning them into friends and protectors, as well as Savonarola, of whom he'd become later on one of the pillars of his 'New Jerusalem' in Florence.\nBorn of a noble family of lords with wide connections, he was destined to the Church, but he quit the seminars to attend the University of Padua, where he soaked in the rediscovered classical texts that Greek scholars had brought with them from lost Constantinople. His interest in Aristotelian thought brought him to all the humanist centres of Italy, and eventually to Paris, the centre of Scholastics. He studied Arab philosophers and scientists, Jewish texts, and avidly sought more remains of Classical thought, and also the works of mystics, Manicheans, Zoroastrians and gnostics, in his efforts to better understand the world and reconcile the opposed schools of Plato and Aristotle.\nHis life of wandering ended when Pope Innocent VIII banned him from defending his 900 Thesis in Rome, when he was only 23, accusing him of heretic and of 'repeating the errors of pagan philosophers'. He fled and was captured several times, always released by intercession of Lorenzo de Medici. He settled down in Florence, where he kept on writing until Savonarola began his preaching. Then, Pico renounced his former ideas, became a monk and burned his poetry and manuscripts. He died of poisoning at age 41, probably by order of Piero de Medici, for being one of Savonarola's supports."

Impressed by the teachings of Gemistos Pletho, Basileios Bessarion and John Argyropoulos during the Council of Florence of 1438-1445, to which even the Emperor of the Romans assisted, and thanks to the exodus of Greek scholars from Constantinople, he studied obsessively the what little was known about Classical philosophy, as well as the late Roman mystics like Plotinus, Iamblichus and Hermes Trismegistos. While he failed in his efforts to synthesize Christianity with Neoplatonism, his works, his translations of Platonic texts and Hermetic commentaries into Latin, and his actualization of Platonism to the fifteenth century mindset made him one of the most influential humanists of all the Renaissance.\n\n'There will be some men or other, superstitious and blind, who see life plain in even the lowest animals and the meanest plants, but do not see life in the heavens or the world ...

One of the most exquisite goods was porcelain, which was considered a precious good like glassware. And like glassware, its production was a secret. The Medici porcelain was the first successful attempt in Europe to make imitations of Chinese porcelain. Historically, the experimental manufactory housed in the Casino of San Marco in Florence existed between 1575 and 1587 under the patronage of Francesco I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany. A painted mark of Brunelleschi's dome and a capital letter F appeared on the underside of some pieces; others bared the Medici palle, the balls that are the Medici heraldic charge. Never a commercial venture, Medici porcelains were sometimes given as diplomatic gifts; for example, surviving pieces bear the arms of Philip II of Spain. The first successes were finally reported in $YEAR$ by the Venetian ambassador Andrea Gussoni, who mentioned in his brief to the Serenissima that $MONARCH$ discovered the means of making 'the porcelain of India.'"

His achievements include improvements to the telescope and consequent astronomical observations and support for Copernicanism. Galileo has been called the 'father of modern observational astronomy', the 'father of modern physics', the 'father of science', and 'the Father of Modern Science'. His contributions to observational astronomy include the telescopic confirmation of the phases of Venus, the discovery of the four largest satellites of Jupiter (named the Galilean moons in his honour), and the observation and analysis of sunspots. Galileo also worked in applied science and technology, inventing an improved military compass and other instruments. In 1589, he was appointed to the chair of mathematics in Pisa. In 1591, his father died and he was entrusted with the care of his younger brother Michelangelo. In 1592, he moved to the University of Padua, teaching geometry, mechanics, and astronomy until 1610. During this period, Galileo made significant discoveries in both pure fundamental science (for example, kinematics of motion and astronomy) as well as practical applied science (for example, strength of materials and improvement of the telescope). His multiple interests included the study of astrology, which at the time was a discipline tied to the studies of mathematics and astronomy. In $YEAR$, he returned to Florenz, famed as one of the greatest scientists of Europe."

 medici_system.EVTDESC59:1 "The Assayer (Il Saggiatore) was a polemic against the treatise on the comets of 1618 by Orazio Grassi, a Jesuit mathematician at the Collegio Romano. In this matter Grassi, for all his Aristotelianism, was right and Galileo was wrong. Galileo incorrectly treated the comets as a play of light rather than as real objects. In 1616 Galileo may have been silenced on Copernicanism. In 1623 his supporter and friend, Cardinal Maffeo Barberini, a former patron of the Lynx and uncle of Cardinal Francesco Barberini, became Pope Urban VIII. The election of Barberini seemed to assure Galileo of support at the highest level in the Church. A visit to Rome confirmed this. Galileo insisted that physics should be mathematical. According to the title page, he was the philosopher or physicist of the Grand Duke of Tuscany, not merely the mathematician. Physics or natural philosophy spans the gamut from processes of generation and growth (represented by a plant) to the physical structure of the universe, represented by the cosmic cross-section. Mathematics, on the other hand, is symbolized by telescopes, and an astrolabe. This is the book containing Galileo's famous statement that mathematics is the language of science. Only through mathematics can one achieve lasting truth in physics. Those who neglect mathematics wander endlessly in a dark labyrinth. \n Although The Assayer contains a magnificent polemic for mathematical physics, ironically its main point was to ridicule a mathematical astronomer. This time, the target of Galileo's wit and sarcasm was the cometary theory of a Jesuit, Orazio Grassi, who argued from parallax that comets move above the Moon. Galileo mistakenly countered that comets are an optical illusion."

Simplicio's arguments are systematically refuted and ridiculed by the other two characters, which reduces Simplicio to baffled rage, and makes the author's position unambiguous. Indeed, although Galileo states in the preface of his book that the character is named after a famous Aristotelian philosopher (Simplicius in Latin, Simplicio in Italian), the name 'Simplicio' in Italian also had the connotation of 'simpleton.' Pope Urban's demand for his own arguments to be included in the book resulted in Galileo putting them in the mouth of Simplicio.

Much of his chamber music follows models established by Joseph Haydn; however, Boccherini is often credited with improving Haydn's model of the string quartet by bringing the cello to prominence, whereas Haydn had frequently relegated it to an accompaniment role. Rather, some sources for Boccherini's style are in the works of a famous Italian cellist, Giovanni Battista Cirri, who was born before Boccherini and before Haydn, and in the Spanish popular music. A virtuoso cellist of high calibre, Boccherini often played violin repertoire on the cello, at pitch, a skill he developed by substituting for ailing violinists while touring. This supreme command of the instrument brought him much praise from his contemporaries (notably Pierre Baillot, Pierre Rode, and Bernhard Romberg), and is evident in the cello parts of his compositions (particularly in the quintets for two cellos, treated often as cello concertos with string quartet accompaniment).

In 1646, dressed as Harlequin during Mardi Gras and amusing bystanders with his clowning and his violin, the boy attracted the attention of Roger de Lorraine, chevalier de Guise, son of Charles, Duke of Guise, who was returning to France and was looking for someone to talk Italian with his niece, Mademoiselle de Montpensier (la Grande Mademoiselle). Guise took the boy to Paris, where the fourteen-year-old entered Mademoiselle's service; from 1647 to 1652 he served as her 'chamber boy' (garçon de chambre). He probably honed his musical skills by working with Mademoiselle's household musicians and with composers Nicolas Métru, François Roberday and Nicolas Gigault. The teenager's talents as a guitarist, violinist, and dancer quickly won him the nicknames 'Baptiste', and 'le grand baladin' (great street-artist). By February 1653 Lully had attracted the attention of the heir, dancing with him in the Ballet royal de la nuit. By 16 March 1653, Lully had been made royal composer for instrumental music."

The power of the republic faded in the last years, when Cosimo de' Medici decided to spend his vast fortune to control Florentine politics. He has established an invisible net of 'friends', allies and de facto vassals. Some members of the council have claimed that he would be a menace for the whole republic if nothing was done to the house of Medici. However, it is clear that Cosimo's abilities are far superior to those of his opponents.

 cosimo_begins.EVTDESC5:1 "The House of Medici was a political dynasty and banking family that first began to gather prominence under Cosimo de' Medici in the Republic of Florence during the late fourteenth century. The family originated in the Mugello region of the Tuscan countryside, gradually rising until they were able to found the Medici Bank. The bank was the largest in Europe during the fifteenth century, seeing the Medici gain political power in Florence - though officially they remained citizens rather than monarchs. Their wealth and influence initially derived from the textile trade guided by the guild of the Arte della Lana. Like other signore families they dominated their city's government, they were able to bring Florence under their family's power, allowing for an environment where art and humanism could flourish. They fostered and inspired the birth of the Italian Renaissance along with other families of Italy, such as the Visconti and Sforza of Milan, the Este of Ferrara, and the Gonzaga of Mantua. The Medici Bank was one of the most prosperous and most respected institutions in Europe. There are some estimates that the Medici family were the wealthiest family in Europe for a period of time. From this base, they acquired political power initially in Florence and later in wider Italy and Europe. In $YEAR$, he became Gonfaloniere of Florence, establishing his system of power even more. The following Gonfalonieri would be chosen by Cosimo, whereas he would stay behind, controlling the republic. It would be the beginning of the 'hidden Signoria' of Florence, in which the Medici seek to install their dynasty forever."

After the festivities on the Piazza, the contradaioli go to the Duomo, the Cathedral of Siena, to celebrate a mass, which is decorated with the flag of the winning contrada.

 palio_siena.EVTNAME1:1 "Preparations for the Palio"
 palio_siena.EVTDESC1:1 "The Palio di Siena is more than a simple horse race. It is the culmination of ongoing rivalry and competition between the contrade (city quarters of Siena). The lead-up and the day of the race are invested with passion and pride. Formal and informal rituals take place as the day proceeds, with each contrada navigating a strategy of horsemanship, alliances, and animosities. There are the final clandestine meetings among the heads of the contrade and then between them and the jockeys (called Fantini in Italian). The first race (Palio di Provenzano) is held on 2 July, which is both the Feast of the Visitation and the date of a local festival in honour of the Madonna of Provenzano (a painting once owned by the Sienese leader Provenzano Salvani, which was supposed to have miraculous curative power). The second race is held on 16 August (Palio dell'Assunta), the day after the Feast of the Assumption, and is likewise dedicated to the Virgin Mary. The horses (called Berberi) are of mixed breed; no purebred horses are allowed. Because of the rivalries between the contrade, Fantini were often hired from outside, because the contrade didn't trust other Sienese. In fact, the Fantino had a status similar to a mercenary who was hired to fight a battle against an enemy. Siena heavily relied on those Fantini from outside, and maybe we should send an offer to our neighbours to send us some very good jockeys for the upcoming race."

 palio_siena.EVTDESC5:1 "A contrada (plural: contrade) is a district, or a ward, within an Italian city. Each is named after an animal or symbol and each with its own long history and complicated set of heraldic and semi-mythological associations. These districts were set up in the Middle Ages in order to supply troops to the many military companies that were hired to defend Siena as it fought to defend its independence from Florence and other nearby city-states. Their roles have broadened so that every important event - baptisms, deaths, marriages, church holidays, victories at the Palio, even wine or food festivals - is celebrated only within one's own contrada. Every contrada has its own museum, fountain and baptismal font, motto, allied contrada and adversary contrada, typically a neighbour. Often the adversary contrade share borders. Traditionally, every contrade held a large feast for its contradaioli (inhabitants of a contrada) before the great day of the Palio."

 palio_siena.EVTDESC6:1 "The drappellone (banner), or palio, known affectionately as 'the rag' in Siena, is the trophy that is to be delivered to the contrada that wins the Palio. The palio is an elongated rectangular piece of silk, hand-painted by an artist for the occasion. It is held vertically on a black-and-white shaft halberd and topped by a silver plate, with two white and black plumes draped down the sides. The palio, along with the plumes, remains the property of the contrada. The plate is returned to the city of Siena before the two Palii of the following year, after the date and the name of the victorious contrada are inscribed on its back. There is one silver platter for the Palio in July and another for the August Palio. The plates are replaced approximately every ten years. The value of the banner is unique, because it represents a particular historical period of the city of Siena. The process that an artist should follow in designing the palio is rigid: it must follow a precise iconography that includes some sacred symbols, as the July Palio is dedicated to the Madonna of Provenzano, and that of August to the Madonna of the Assumption. It must present the insignia of the city, those of the third part of the city, and the symbols or colours of the ten contrade participating in the race. There are, however, no limits regarding the style of the art."

 palio_siena.EVTNAME7:1 "Betting at the Prove"
 palio_siena.EVTDESC7:1 "At the Palio, a lottery determines which horse will run for each contrada. Then, six trial races are run, the first on the evening of the horse selection and the last on the morning before the Palio. The devout residents of each contrada invoke the sacred aid of their patron saint for their horse and jockey. The worldly improve their odds with arguably dubious methods, chiefly bribery and doping. The sensible simply keep a close watch on their stable and their rider. The Palio differs from 'normal' horse races in that part of the game is for the wards to prevent rival contrade from winning. When a contrada fails to win, its historical enemy will celebrate that fact nearly as merrily as a victory of its own, regardless of whether adversarial interference was a deciding factor. Few things are forbidden to the jockeys during the race; for instance, they can pull or shove their fellows, hit the horses and each other, or try to hamper other horses at the start. Clearly, in all those circumstances, betting happened quite frequently, because everything could happen."

In fact, in Siena the Fantino on the second place is looked with the deepest mistrust - because he had the chance to win, in contrary to the last. When an enemy lost, the rivals festival. That is Siena, that is Palio. On another note: in the nineteenth century, there was a guy called Pierre de Coubertin.

The tenth, the rincorsa, waits outside. When the rincorsa finally enters the space between the ropes the starter (mossiere) activates a mechanism that instantly drops the canapo (the front rope). This process (the mossa) can take a very long time, as deals have usually been made between various contrade and jockeys that affect when the rincorsa moves - he may be waiting for a particular other horse to be well- or badly-placed, for example. On the dangerous, steeply canted track, the riders are allowed to use their whips (in Italian, nerbi, stretched, dried bulls' hide) not only for their own horse, but also for disturbing other horses and riders. The Palio in fact is won by the horse who represents his contrada, and not by the jockeys. The winner is the first horse to cross the finish line—a horse can win without its rider (a condition known as cavallo scosso). A horse can also win without its decorative headgear (spennacchiera), although the opposite belief is widely held even among the Sienese.

In 1492 the poet entertained his patron with a dramatic piece, the Triunfo de la fama. In 1496 he published his Cancionero, a collection of dramatic and lyrical poems. He then applied for the cantor post at Salamanca Cathedral, but the position was divided among three singers, including his rival Lucas Fernandez.

Writers as diverse as Baldassare Castiglione and Martin Luther wrote about his reputation and fame; theorists such as Heinrich Glarean and Gioseffo Zarlino held his style as that best representing perfection. Yet in spite of Josquin's colossal reputation, which endured until the beginning of the Baroque era and was revived in the twentieth century, his biography is shadowy, and next to nothing is known about his personality. The only surviving work which may be in his own hand is a graffito on the wall of the Sistine Chapel, and only one contemporary mention of his character is known, in a letter to $MONARCH$. Josquin wrote both sacred and secular music, and in all of the significant vocal forms of the age, including masses, motets, chansons and frottole. During the sixteenth century, he was praised for both his supreme melodic gift and his use of ingenious technical devices."
 opera_musica.EVTNAME5:1 "Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina"
 opera_musica.EVTDESC5:1 "Palestrina was an Italian Renaissance composer of sacred music and the best-known sixteenth century representative of the Roman School of musical composition. He has had a lasting influence on the development of church music, and his work has often been seen as the culmination of Renaissance polyphony. Palestrina left hundreds of compositions, including 105 masses, 68 offertories, at least 140 madrigals and more than 300 motets. In addition, there are at least 72 hymns, 35 magnificats, 11 litanies, and four or five sets of lamentations. One of the hallmarks of Palestrina's music is that dissonances are typically relegated to the 'weak' beats in a measure. This produced a smoother and more consonant type of polyphony which are now considered to be definitive of late Renaissance music, given Palestrina's position as Europe's leading composer (along with Lassus) in the wake of Josquin. The 'Palestrina style' now serves as a basis for college Renaissance counterpoint classes, thanks in large part to the efforts of the eighteenth century composer and theorist Johann Joseph Fux, who, in a book called Gradus ad Parnassum (Steps to Parnassus, 1725), set about codifying Palestrina's techniques as a pedagogical tool for students of composition. Palestrina was famous in his day, and if anything his reputation increased after his death."

He is sometimes known as 'El Viejo' (the elder) to distinguish him from his nephew, Mateo Flecha 'El Joven' (the younger), also a composer of madrigals. 'El Viejo' is best known for his ensaladas, published by the same nephew. Mateo Flecha directed the music at the cathedral of Lleida (September 1523 - October 1525). From there he moved to Guadalajara, in the service for six years of the Duke, Diego Hurtado de Mendoza. From there he went to Valencia where he assumed direction of the chapel choir of the Duke of Calabria. While thus employed, three of his works were included in songbooks associated with that chapel, including the Cancionero de Uppsala (Falala... you know what I mean, eh?). Flecha is best known as composer of the 'ensalada' (literally 'salad'), a work for four or five voices written for the diversion of courtiers in the palace. The ensalada frequently mixed languages: Spanish, Catalan, Italian, French, and Latin. In addition to the ensalada, Flecha is known for his villancicos, or Christmas carols. Various Spanish vihuelists, like Enríquez de Valderrábano, Diego Pisador, and Miguel de Fuenllana, adapted Flecha's works for the vihuela."

Ortiz published two music books: Trattado de Glosas in 1553 and Musices liber primus in 1565. The Trattado de Glosas (modern Spanish spelling Tratado de Glosas) is considered a masterpiece of literature for the viola da gamba. The work was published on 10 December 1553, in Rome under the Spanish title Trattado de glossas sobre clausulas y otros generos de punctos en la musica de violones nuevamente puestos en luz. Its Italian title is Glose sopra le cadenze et altre sorte de punti in la musica del violone. Ortiz published a collection of polyphonic religious music in 1565 in Venice. Musices liber primus hymnos, Magnificas, Salves, motecta, psalmos includes sixty-nine compositions for four to seven voices, based on plainchant works."

Lassus was born in Mons in the County of Hainaut. At the age of twelve, he left the Low Countries and went to Mantua, Sicily, and later Milan (from 1547 to 1549). While in Milan, he made the acquaintance of the madrigalist Spirito l'Hoste da Reggio, a formative influence on his early musical style. He then worked as a singer and a composer in Naples in the early 1550s, and his first works are presumed to date from this time. Next he moved to Rome, where he became maestro di cappella of the Basilica di San Giovanni in Laterano. In 1556 he joined the court of $MONARCH$ who was consciously attempting to create a musical establishment on a par with the major courts in Italy. Lassus was one of several Netherlanders to work there, and by far the most famous. He evidently was happy in Munich and decided to settle there. By the 1560s Lassus had become quite famous, and composers began to go to Munich to study with him. The Pope knighted, the King of France invited, the Emperor visited him. One of the most prolific, versatile, and universal composers of the late Renaissance, Lassus wrote over 2,000 works in all Latin, French, Italian and German vocal genres known in his time. These include 530 motets, 175 Italian madrigals and villanellas, 150 French chansons, and 90 German lieder."

 opera_musica.EVTDESC9:1 "Antonio Valente was an Italian Renaissance organist and composer. He was blind from childhood and served as organist of Sant'Angelo a Nilo in Naples in 1565-80. During that time he published two collections of organ music: Intavolatura de cimbalo (1 fantasia, 6 ricercares, Salve regina, 3 intabulations, 6 sets of variations, and 3 dances; 1575) and Versi spirituali (43 versets; 1580). Valente's second collection is historically important as one of the earliest instances of liturgical music free from any ties with the chant. Versi spirituali provides a wealth of diverse, freely composed pieces that cover the entire liturgy—the Mass and the Daily Offices. Valente's 1575 print, although of considerably lower quality, is also a major landmark in the history of Italian keyboard music, for together with Rocco Rodio's Libro di ricercate (1575) it constitutes the earliest work of the so-called Neapolitan school, which later produced composers such as Ascanio Mayone and Giovanni Maria Trabaci."

Around 80 of his instruments are still in existence: violins (small and large), alto and tenor violas, viols, violones and double basses, violas with only a pair of corners, ceteras. He was born in Salò on Lake Garda, in a family with legal, artistic, musical and craft interests. When his father died, around 1562, he moved to Brescia. It appears Gasparo immediately rented a house and set up shop in the neighbourhood hub of musical life, the Contrada Antegnati, known for the presence of a very famous dynasty of organ builders and other skilled multi-instrumentalists, from 1528 granted from the Brescia City Council, with a professional patent (first example in Europe), all of whom were located in the Second Quadra St. John, in front of the Palazzo Vecchio del Podestà (now Via Cairoli). Gasparo developed the art of string making to a very high level, and passed on this tradition to five known students. In 1575 he bought a house in the Cossere district, his historic headquarters, and subsequently manufactured many instruments. His workshop quickly became one of the most important in Europe in the second half of the sixteenth century for the production of every type of stringed instrument of the time. Until today, Gasparo is considered the inventor of the modern violin."

 opera_musica.EVTDESC11:1 "William Byrd was an English composer of the Renaissance. He wrote in many of the forms current in England at the time, including various types of sacred and secular polyphony, keyboard (the so-called Virginalist school) and consort music. Byrd's output of about 470 compositions amply justifies his reputation as one of the great masters of European Renaissance music. Perhaps his most impressive achievement as a composer was his ability to transform so many of the main musical forms of his day and stamp them with his own identity. Having grown up in an age in which Latin polyphony was largely confined to liturgical items for the Sarum rite, he assimilated and mastered the Continental motet form of his day, employing a highly personal synthesis of English and continental models. He virtually created the Tudor consort and keyboard fantasia, having only the most primitive models to follow. He also raised the consort song, the church anthem and the Anglican service setting to new heights. Finally, despite a general aversion to the madrigal, he succeeded in cultivating secular vocal music in an impressive variety of forms in his three sets of 1588, 1589 and 1611. Although Byrd had a major reputation in England during his lifetime, his music was in many respects curiously uninfluential."

 opera_musica.EVTDESC12:1 "Claudio Giovanni Antonio Monteverdi was an Italian composer, gambist, singer and Roman Catholic priest. Monteverdi's work, often regarded as revolutionary, marked the transition from the Renaissance style of music to that of the Baroque period. He developed two individual styles of composition - the heritage of Renaissance polyphony and the new basso continuo technique of the Baroque. He was recognised as an innovative composer and enjoyed considerable fame in his lifetime. Monteverdi composed at least eighteen operas, but only L'Orfeo, Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria, L'incoronazione di Poppea, and the famous aria, Lamento, from his second opera L'Arianna have survived. From monody (with melodic lines, intelligible text and placid accompanying music), it was a logical step for Monteverdi to begin composing opera. In 1607, his first opera, L'Orfeo, premiered in Mantua. L'Orfeo was not the first opera, but it was the first mature opera, or one that realised all of its potential. It was normal at that time for composers to create works on demand for special occasions, and this piece was part of the celebrations of carnival. Until today, Monteverdi is considered one of the greatest composers of all time, having a major influence on European orchestral music as a whole."
 opera_musica.EVTNAME13:1 "Giovanni Gabrieli"
 opera_musica.EVTDESC13:1 "Gabrieli was an Italian composer and organist. He was one of the most influential musicians of his time, and represents the culmination of the style of the Venetian School, at the time of the shift from Renaissance to Baroque idioms. He became principal organist at Saint Mark's Basilica in 1585, after Claudio Merulo left the post; following his uncle's death the following year he took the post of principal composer as well. Gabrieli's career rose further when he took the additional post of organist at the Scuola Grande di San Rocco, another post he retained for his entire life. San Rocco was the most prestigious and wealthy of all the Venetian confraternities, and second only to San Marco itself in splendour of its musical establishment. Some of the most renowned singers and instrumentalists in Italy performed there and a vivid description of its musical activity survives in the travel memoirs of the English writer Thomas Coryat. Much of his music was written specifically for that location, although he probably composed even more for San Marco. San Marco had a long tradition of musical excellence and Gabrieli's work there made him one of the most noted composers in Europe. The vogue that began with his influential volume Sacrae symphoniae (1597) was such that composers from all over Europe, especially from Germany, came to Venice to study. Evidently he also made his new pupils study the madrigals being written in Italy, so not only did they carry back the grand Venetian polychoral style to their home countries, but also the more intimate style of madrigals; Heinrich Schütz and others helped transport the transitional early Baroque music north to Germany, a trend that decisively affected subsequent music history. The productions of the German Baroque, culminating in the music of J.S. Bach, were founded on this strong tradition, which had its roots in Venice."
 opera_musica.EVTNAME14:1 "Tomás Luis de Victoria"
 opera_musica.EVTDESC14:1 "Tomás Luis de Victoria, sometimes Italianised as da Vittoria, was the most famous composer of the sixteenth century in Spain, and one of the most important composers of the Counter-Reformation, along with Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina and Orlando di Lasso. Victoria was not only a composer, but also an accomplished organist and singer as well as a Catholic priest. However, he preferred the life of a composer to that of a performer. He is sometimes known as the 'Spanish Palestrina' because he may have been taught by Palestrina. Victoria is one of the best-regarded composers of sacred music in the late Renaissance, a genre to which he devoted himself exclusively. Victoria's music reflected his intricate personality. In his music, the passion of Spanish mysticism and religion is expressed. Victoria was praised by Padre Martini for his melodic phrases and his joyful inventions. Many commentators hear in his music a mystical intensity and direct emotional appeal, qualities considered by some to be lacking in the arguably more rhythmically and harmonically placid music of Palestrina. There are quite a few differences in their compositional styles, such as treatment of melody and quarter-note dissonances. Victoria was a master at overlapping and dividing choirs with multiple parts with a gradual decreasing of rhythmic distance throughout. Not only does Victoria incorporate intricate parts for the voices, but the organ is treated almost like a soloist in many of his choral pieces. His most famous work, and his masterpiece, was a Requiem Mass for $MONARCHTITLE$ $RANDOM_OLD_MONARCH$."

His salary was half that of the maestro de capilla, Juan de Cepa. Manuscript M1166-M1967 of the Biblioteca de Catalunya includes works by both Càrceres and Cepa. For example the villancico Soleta y verge, an adaptation of a secular song from the Cancionero de Upsala appears in a version for three voices by Càrceres and a variation developed from this for five voices with refrain by Cepa. However, even if many people don't know his name and work, he became extremely popular because of one particular song - a villancico - which would destroy minds and souls of Europa Universalis players in the 21th century."

A prolific and highly original composer, Kapsberger is chiefly remembered today for his lute, theorbo and chitarrone music, which was seminal in the development of these as solo instruments. At least six collections were published during his lifetime, two of which are currently lost. Kapsberger's writing is characterised, especially in toccatas, by spontaneous changes, sharp contrasts, unusual rhythmic groupings and, sometimes, passages that do not conform to the rules of counterpoint that were in use at the time. The vast majority of contemporary critics praised Kapsberger's compositional skill and innovations. Among them was Athanasius Kircher, who described Kapsberger as a 'superb genius' and attested that he has 'successfully penetrated the secrets of music.' Also, Kapsberger's toccatas may have influenced those of Girolamo Frescobaldi, much like French lute music would, some years later, influence Johann Jakob Froberger's suites."

These were quite popular in the court, and for these he was remembered in later years as he who 'founded and firmly established the empire of the viol'. His other works include a book of Pièces en trio and four operas, Alcyone being noted for its tempest scene. Marais is credited with being one of the earliest composers of program music.

He composed a large body of sacred and secular music, and his contributions to the development of the chorale prelude and fugue have earned him a place among the most important composers of the middle Baroque era. Pachelbel's music enjoyed enormous popularity during his lifetime; he had many pupils and his music became a model for the composers of south and central Germany. Today, Pachelbel is best known for the Canon in D, as well as the Chaconne in F minor, the Toccata in E minor for organ, and the Hexachordum Apollinis, a set of keyboard variations. Pachelbel's music was influenced by southern German composers, such as Johann Jakob Froberger and Johann Kaspar Kerll, Italians such as Girolamo Frescobaldi and Alessandro Poglietti, French composers, and the composers of the Nuremberg tradition. He preferred a lucid, uncomplicated contrapuntal style that emphasised melodic and harmonic clarity. His music is less virtuosic and less adventurous harmonically than that of Dieterich Buxtehude, although, like Buxtehude, Pachelbel experimented with different ensembles and instrumental combinations in his chamber music and, most importantly, his vocal music, much of which features exceptionally rich instrumentation. Pachelbel explored many variation forms and associated techniques, which manifest themselves in various diverse pieces, from sacred concertos to harpsichord suites."

Until then, the Lombard capital was highly influenced by Gothic architectural tradition, but Bramante would introduce the new Renaissance style to the city. Historically, the Duke made him virtually his court architect, beginning in 1476, with commissions that culminated in the famous trompe-l'oeil choir of the church of Santa Maria presso San Satiro (1482–1486). Space was limited, and Bramante made a theatrical apse in bas-relief, combining the painterly arts of perspective with Roman details. He also built the tribune of Santa Maria delle Grazie, the place where Leonardo painted the 'Last supper'. When Milan was conquered by the French in 1499, Bramente decided to move to Rome, where he would convince Julius II to rebuild St. Peter's Basilica. Really, a great man of the Renaissance..."

 architecture.EVTDESC16:1 "Palladio, influenced by Roman and Greek architecture, primarily by Vitruvius, is widely considered the most influential individual in the history of Western architecture. All of his buildings are located in what was the Venetian Republic, but his teachings, summarized in the architectural treatise, The Four Books of Architecture, gained him wide recognition. He designed many palaces, villas, and churches, but Palladio's reputation, initially, and after his death, has been founded on his skill as a designer of villas. The palladian villas are located mainly in the province of Vicenza, while the palazzi are concentrated in the city of Vicenza and the churches in Venice. A number of his works are now protected as part of the World Heritage Site City of Vicenza and the Palladian Villas of the Veneto. Other buildings by Palladio are to be found within the Venice and its Lagoon World Heritage Site. Palladio's first major public project began when his designs for building the loggias for the town hall, known as the Basilica Palladiana, were approved in 1548. He proposed an addition of two-story stone buttresses reflecting the Gothic style of the existing hall while using classical proportions. The construction was completed in 1617 after Palladio's death."
 architecture.EVTNAME17:1 "Juan de Herrera"
 architecture.EVTDESC17:1 "One of the most outstanding Spanish architects in the sixteenth century, Herrera represents the peak of the Renaissance in Spain. His sober style was fully developed in buildings like the Monastery of San Lorenzo de El Escorial. The Herrerian style was named after him, and was representative of the architecture of $MONARCH$ and his successors. As a Renaissance man, Herrera was interested in all the branches of knowledge of his times. His Discurso sobre la figura cúbica (Discussion of the Cubic form) tells us about his notable knowledge about geometry and mathematics. In 1563 he starts his collaborations with Juan Bautista de Toledo in the construction of El Escorial. In 1562 he had written the Book of the Astronomical knowledge (Libro del sabre de astronomía). After the death of Juan Bautista de Toledo in 1567, Herrera becomes the director architect of the works. Herrera modifies the plans and enlarges the program, changing the image of the façades and introducing his personal sober style."
 architecture.EVTNAME18:1 "Francois Mansart"
 architecture.EVTDESC18:1 "Francois Mansart was a French architect credited with introducing classicism into Baroque architecture of France. Mansart, as he is generally known, made extensive use of a four-sided, double slope gambrel roof punctuated with windows on the steeper lower slope, creating additional habitable space in the garrets that ultimately became named for him - the mansard roof. Mansart was highly recognised since the 1620s for his style and skill as an architect, but he was viewed as a stubborn and difficult perfectionist, tearing down his structures in order to start building them over again. Only the richest could afford to have him work for them, as Mansart's constructions cost 'more money than the Great Turk himself possesses'."
 architecture.EVTNAME19:1 "Balthasar Neumann"
 architecture.EVTDESC19:1 "Balthasar Neumann was a German military artillery engineer and architect who developed a refined brand of Baroque architecture, fusing Austrian, Bohemian, Italian, and French elements to design some of the most impressive buildings of the period, including the Würzburg Residence and the Basilica of the Fourteen Holy Helpers, called Vierzehnheiligen in German. In 1715, Neumann had already emerged as a rising talent and come to the notice of the Elector of Mainz. After a period of time under the direction of the Würzburg architect Andreas Müller and Joseph Greising, in 1719, the newly appointed Prince-Bishop of Würzburgappointed Neumann the chief engineer in Würzburg. Neumann took this position in 1720 after all the planning for the construction of the Würzburg Residence, which is considered one of the most beautiful and well-proportioned palaces in Europe. Neuman was one of the most influential and famous architects of Germany and was honoured in the twentieth century when a picture of him could be seen on the 50-DM note."

 architecture.EVTDESC20:1 "Robert Adam was a leader of the first phase of the classical revival in England and Scotland from around 1760 until his death. He was the son of William Adam, the country's foremost architect of the time, and trained under him. With his older brother John, Robert took on the family business, which included lucrative work for the Board of Ordnance, after William's death. In 1754 he left for Rome, spending nearly five years on the continent studying architecture under Charles-Louis Clérisseau and Giovanni Battista Piranesi. On his return to Britain he established a practise in London, where he was joined by his younger brother James. Here he developed the 'Adam Style', and his theory of 'movement' in architecture, based on his studies of antiquity and became one of the most successful and fashionable architects in the country. Adam held the post of Architect of the King's Works from 1761 to 1769."

He worked on the Monastery of Bathala and then planned the Hieronymites Monastery in Lisbon. The Manueline style is characterised by virtuoso complex ornamentation in portals, windows, columns and arcades. In its end period it tended to become excessively exuberant as in Tomar."

In those years, during various exhibitions, a Turkish acrobat did something that stupefied the Venetians. With the only aid of a pole he walked on a rope from a boat tied in Riva degli Schiavoni to the top of St. Mark's Tower and then from the tower to the Doge's Palace balcony, as a tribute to the doge. From that on, the attraction became an important element of Venetian tradition in Carnival days.

 italian_power.EVTNAME1:1 "The Italian Balance"
 italian_power.EVTDESC1:1 "In Early Modern times, the Italian peninsula was dominated by the factor of balance. In fact, the historical term of 'balance of power' has its roots in Italy, not England. The term of 'bilancia' was first used by Venetian ambassadors in the mid-fifteenth century, but also by such notable Florentine authors like Ruccellai, Machiavelli or Guicciardini. Preserving the status quo was the highest rule. No Italian power should have once again a hegemony like the Visconti of Milan had in the fourteenth century. Florence and Venice made an alliance to break the heritage of the Visconti, which lead to a more split, but also balanced peninsula, in which the five powers of the 'Italian Pentarchy' (Milan, Venice, Florence, Naples and the Pope) ruled the game of power. Later, when the Italian League was formed, it was those powers which preserved peace and prosperity in Italian lands, leading to the Renaissance - a cultural and a technological springtime for whole Europe. However, it is not clear if the Italian countries may overcome their differences to keep strangers - France, Aragon/Spain, the Ottomans, the Emperor - out of Italian affairs. Scepticism between the Italian powers is high, and every expansion in the Italian region will be observed with fear that once again one power may dominate the others. Especially Venice is considered to be the most dangerous by some observers and will have a pretty hard time to gain new territory. Florence has its own problems, because the ruling Medici family wants to achieve full power in the republic. In Naples, the reign of a bastard King may be the beginning of a new age for Southern Italy, but the House of Anjou is still interested to take its lands back. The Pope has to consolidate his vassals and the de jure borders of the donation of Constantine. And Milan, once the most important power in Italy, will continue to live in challenging times.\nEvery new move in this game of chess will have consequences. An Italian power must be prepared... force alone is not the way to rule as a true Prince."

Taranto became the capital of the principality, which covered almost all of the heel of Apulia. During its subsequent 377 years of history, it was sometimes a powerful and almost independent feudal fief of the Kingdom of Sicily (and later of Naples), sometimes only a title, often given to the heir to the crown or to the husband of a reigning queen. When the House of Anjou was divided, Taranto fell to the house of Durazzo (1394–1463). Ferdinand I of Naples united the Principality of Taranto to the Kingdom of Naples at the death of his wife, Isabella of Clermont. The principality came to an end, but the kings of Naples continued giving the title of Prince of Taranto to their sons, firstly to the future Alfonso II of Naples, eldest son of Isabella."
