 tianxia.41.d:1 "We assert our dominance over the people of the plains. Just like when Trisong Detsän of the illustrious Bod wrested Chang'an, capital of Tang dynasty, we shall rule over Han!\nWhat name should our new Empire bear?"
 tianxia.41.a:1 "We shall be known as the Great Tufan!"
 tianxia.42.d:1 "We assert our dominance over the people of the plains. One of our great ancestors, Yao Chang ruled Han as an Emperor of Qin during the era of Sixteen Kingdoms. The fate of his state was tragic, but his people lived on. On the other hand, our brothers Minyak of Western Xia ruled a powerful Empire equal to that of Liao and Song. We shall rebuild the glory of Qiang people!\nWhat name should our new Empire bear?"
 tianxia.43.d:1 "We assert our dominance over the people of the plains. Never again shall we be subservient to Han or Mongols! We are the proud descendants of King Gwanggaetto the Great of Goguryeo who reclaimed our homeland in Liaodong, King Geunchogo of Baekje who controlled land in Liaoxi and civilised Japan, King Mumnu of Silla who unified Korea and removed armies of Tang from our land. After decades of subordination, we shall rule all under the Heaven!\n What name should our new Empire bear?"
 tianxia.44.d:1 "We assert our dominance over the people of the plains. Our great Jin Empire ruled by the Wanggiya clan once ruled over all of North China and only thanks to the benevolence of our divine Emperors was the Song dynasty left standing. However, the treacherous Han attacked our peaceful state when we were pacifying some Mongols leading to an unexpected fall of our hegemony. Now it is the time to reorganise our brethren and once again rule the World!\nWhat name should our new Empire bear??"
 tianxia.45.d:1 "We assert our dominance over the people of the plains. We are the descendants of Chuy tribe of the Onoq Khaganate and before that of Yueban of Xiongnu! Our leaders were loyal partners of Tang Emperors, and even after the dynasty fell we were trying to resurrect it. However our newly restored Tang dynasty wasn't strong enough and a new leader rose, Shi Jingtang, who declared rise of Jin dynasty. This state fell however to the treacherous Khitans and our dominance had to be rebuilt by Liu Zhiyuan who proclaimed restored Han dynasty. Ultimately we had to surrender to our neighbours and live in the pastures of Ordos. However no longer!\nWhat name should our new Empire bear?"
 tianxia.46.d:1 "We assert our dominance over the people of the plains. We, proud descendants of Baiyue and Nanyue shall now return our ancestral lands back under our domination. Since times of Qin the people of Central plains were enslaving our people, forcing us to adopt their culture and traditions to survive. The great heroes like Trung sisters or Emperor Ly Bi valiantly opposed the invading hordes, and finally Ngo Quyen managed to defeat Han and finally ended the Chinese domination by building Dai Co Viet. We shall pay back the Han for our misery a thousandfold!\nWhat name should our new Empire bear?"
 tianxia.47.d:1 "We assert our dominance over the people of the plains. We are Daur, descendants of the great Khitans! Our ancestors once ruled the Great Steppe from Oxus to Eastern Sea. Unfortunately, our people and our Great Liao Empire was dispersed by the Mongols. The bulk of our people are now one with Mongols and Turks, but we Daurs are the true successors to the legacy of Yelu clan!\nWhat name should our new Empire bear?"
 tianxia.48.d:1 "We assert our dominance over the people of the plains. Since the time immemorial we looked with curiosity to the west, where the rich Central Plains lay. They looked at us with disdain, barbarians they called us! No longer will Han look down on us for we shall rule them all!\nWhat name should our new Empire bear?"
 tianxia.49.d:1 "We assert our dominance over the people of the plains. The legacy of the Great Khaan calls to us! Mongols in China grew weak, their Khans are shadows of their ancestors, only we can restore the Mongols to the throne of the World!\n What name should our new Empire bear?"
 tianxia.50.d:1 "We assert our dominance over the people of the plains. The legacy of the Great Khaan calls to us! The followers of the While Wolf shall once again subjugate Chinese and prove that our ways are better!!\n What name should our new Empire bear?"
 tianxia.51.d:1 "We assert our dominance over the people of the plains. Han tried to subjugate us for centuries, murdering and massacring our women and children. Our great ancestors like Nungz Ciqgaoh strived to unite our people and expel the barbarians, but unfortunately their Great Nan and Changqi fell. We should honour their legacy by freeing our people!\n What name should our new Empire bear?"

 tianxia.120.t:1 "Succession Law"
 tianxia.120.d:1 "The founders of new dynasties had the responsibility to make sure their descendants won't destroy their grand enterprise. Qin and Sui fell because after the great first Emperor the following ones turned up failures. Jin on the other hand fell because princes were more concerned with fighting over the throne, than protecting the borders. Who shall succeed [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] [Root.Monarch.GetName] after he leaves the world?\n\nShould we enforce a strict rule of primogeniture, which should put a stop to endless line of claimants?
