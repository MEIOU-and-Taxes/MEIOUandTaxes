 DG_Papacy.001.desc: "Alas, God has called His faithful servants to Him in Heaven, and the nation mourns his passing. With the death of a Cardinal, his scarlet robes of office were suspended from the ceiling of his cathedral. With no set number of cardinals, it was up to the Pope to decide when or if to replace a Cardinal. We can only hope that his holiness will see the wisdom in appointing more [Root.Owner.GetAdjective] Cardinals in the future. For now, our influence in the Vatican has been diminished."

 DG_Papacy.002.desc: "At a consistory in the Vatican, several [Root.Owner.GetAdjective] Archbishops were elevated to the rank of Cardinal, receiving their rings of office and silk hats from the Pope himself. Joining the Sacred College of Cardinals, they have become some of the most influential men in the Catholic Church, able to decide on matters of faith and to vote in the election of the next pope. Assigned to churches in the Holy City, they are likely to spend the rest of their days in the Vatican - but will surely remember their days in [Root.GetName] fondly."

After a few weeks, his opponents succeeded in imprisoning him on the strength of a rumor that he intended to flee. He was first brought into the residence of a canon and then into the prison of the Dominican monastery. The emperor, as the guarantor of Hus’ safety, was greatly angered and threatened the prelates with dismissal. The prelates convinced him that he could not be bound by promises to a heretic.\n\nExtracts from his works were read and witnesses were heard. He refused all formulae of submission but declared himself willing to recant if his errors should be proven to him from the Bible. Hus conceded his veneration of Wycliffe and said that he could only wish his soul might some time attain unto that place where Wycliffe's was.\n\nThe question is now, what should be done?"

These stringent measures were meant to avoid an anti-pope claiming victory, but they could also result in deadlocked conclaves. Factions supporting different candidates sometimes refused to compromise or back down, vote after vote, sometimes for months on end.

However, this practice has raised eyebrows among the [Root.GetAdjective] clergy, who are uncomfortable with the idea that the Pope should enrich himself in such a manner.

This is upsetting pious Catholics in $PROVINCENAME$, who are openly wondering if such a wicked man can truly claim to speak with God's authority.\n\nIn an attempt to keep priests from attempting to pass their benefices to their sons, the Catholic Church banned priests from marrying in 1059 AD. Rather than putting an end to the practise, it merely drove it underground. Many priests were uneducated peasants who found abstinence to be challenging, and it was common practise for parish priests to have a 'housekeeper' living with him - and sometimes 'nephews' who bore a striking resemblance to the priest himself. Such disregard for their vows made many Catholics doubt the sanctity of the sacraments the priests offered them. This was bad enough, but to have a bishop do the same was a slap in the face. It was usually ignored, though, since rulers often treated bishoprics as a convenient position for second-born sons."

An indulgence was a way to bypass doing penance by getting the church to bless you with some of the grace of dead saints. Unscrupulous indulgence peddlers went much further, promising that indulgences meant you didn't have to go to confession, that they could allow the dead to escape purgatory, even that they could be used to forgive sins that people had not yet committed!  Pious theologians were horrified at these claims but credulous peasants bought them up rapidly. Soon a steady flow of gold passed into the hands of such peddlers, to be split between them, the archbishops who had authorised it, and the pope himself."

Ecclesiastical (church) courts tended to be more lenient than secular ones; crimes that normally resulted in the execution of the guilty, such as sodomy or bestiality, resulted in sentences of pilgrimages or public confession instead. Over time, anyone who could claim clerical status in any way - such as university students, who were technically clergy - asked to be tried in an ecclesiastical court. While perfectly legal, it was not popular with the public if a heinous crime was punished lightly, nor with rulers if they could not execute a troublesome opponent. At times, the $MONARCHTITLE$ would become personally involved in a case to ensure that the accused did not receive a church trial. Religious leaders protested when this happened but were largely impotent to do anything."

Instead, many people found ways to devote themselves to God in direct, tangible ways.\n\nThis manifested as a revival of interest in spiritual traditions like pilgrimages, joining Confraternities, participating in Passion plays and venerating saints and relics. It also inspired new practises such as praying the Rosary, venerating Mary during mass, taking up the Stations of the Cross and purchasing indulgences. In Northern Europe, pious women joined communities of Beguines - women who did not join a nunnery, but who lived life as if they had. Like-minded men joined the Brethren of the Common Life. Religious art increasingly aimed at making holy figures seem human, emotional and approachable.\n\nPopular piety was a religious revival, but it took place outside the hierarchical church and sometimes went against its teachings. The Catholic Church tolerated these minor deviations and eventually incorporated most of them as official doctrine over the next several centuries, but at the time, it was controversial within the Church."

This ranged from public confession or pilgrimages overseas all the way to becoming a monk or being burned at the stake. Nearly all the time, a sinner who confessed his guilt was spared the ultimate penalty, instead being burned in effigy. However, unrepentant heretics and those who were caught a second time could be sentenced to death. The inquisition had no authority to do so, however, and so such prisoners were handed over to the civil authorities who carried out the executions. All of this would take place in a carefully orchestrated event in which thousands of prisoners convicted over the previous months would be brought to a public square to confess their guilt and begin their penance, culminating in the burning of effigies or the execution of heretics. This 'Auto da fe' was a public spectacle that helped to maintain religious unity and demonstrate the power of the inquisition."

Ironically, one of the chief tenets of Calvinism was the idea that the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], not the pope, should be the head of the church in [Root.GetName].\n\nDispleased with the situation, the pope sent a strongly worded missive to [Root.Monarch.GetName], demanding that $RULER_S_PRONOUN$ do $RULER_ADJ$ Christian duty and reinstate Catholic priests loyal to [the_vatican.GetCapitalName] while excommunicating the heretics and placing them on trial - something that should have been done years ago!  The pope hinted darkly that unless the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] agreed to persecute the Calvinists, the church might have to call a crusade to set things right."
 DG_Reformed.008.desc: "Outraged over the council's decision to ban Calvinism, several dozen Calvinist barons met and declared that they rejected the council's opinion. Vowing to ask a future pope to reassess their doctrines, they agreed to work together to support it. Naming themselves after the martyr of the council, these Calvinist lords formed a league, using their authority to appoint Calvinan priests to their lands and allowing them to preach in public.\n\nIn response, several dozen Catholic nobles formed a 'Romanist' league, under the authority of the bishop in charge of rooting out the heresy, expelling Calvinan priests from their benefices. Between the two, a steady trickle of refugees left [Root.GetName]. While tense, the situation remained bloodless - but that could change if the balance of power tipped to one side."

 DG_Hussites.006.desc: "Shocking news has reached us!  The ecumenical council convened in [hud_synod_site.GetName] has declared that Wycliffitism, that reform movement sweeping $COUNTRY$, is heresy! Supporters must recant their belief in it or face excommunication - and the council has appointed a $PRIMARY_CULTURE$ bishop with the power to strip heretic priests of their benefices and excommunicate heretics who refuse to repent.\n\nThis would be bad enough, but there is worse news: a [DG_HusPreacher] who went to the council to argue in favour of Wycliffitism was imprisoned and placed on trial. Found guilty of heresy, he refused to recant, and was handed over to the emperor and burned at the stake - despite having been promised safe passage! This betrayal has incensed our people, who are rioting, burning churches and lynching monks. Perhaps their outrage could be turned to our advantage."
 DG_Hussites.007.desc: "Outraged over the council's decision to ban Hussitism, several dozen Hussite barons met and declared that they rejected the council's opinion. Vowing to ask a future pope to reassess their doctrines, they agreed to work together to support it. Naming themselves after the martyr of the council, these Hussite lords formed a league, using their authority to appoint Hussite priests to their lands and allowing them to preach in public.\n\nIn response, several dozen Catholic nobles formed a 'Romanist' league, under the authority of the bishop in charge of rooting out the heresy, expelling Wycliffite priests from their benefices. Between the two, a steady trickle of refugees left [Root.GetName]. While tense, the situation remained bloodless - but that could change if the balance of power tipped to one side."
 DG_Hussites.008.desc: "The Catholic church had appointed a bishop to root out the Hussitism heresy in [Root.GetName] and given him the powers necessary to excommunicate and dispossess heretics of their benefices. However, the church soon found that its authority in [Root.GetName] was limited without the support of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. Ironically, one of the chief tenets of Hussitism was the idea that the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], not the pope, should be the head of the church in [Root.GetName].\n\nDispleased with the situation, the pope sent a strongly worded missive to [Root.Monarch.GetName], demanding that $RULER_S_PRONOUN$ do $RULER_ADJ$ Christian duty and reinstate Catholic priests loyal to [the_vatican.GetCapitalName] while excommunicating the heretics and placing them on trial - something that should have been done years ago!  The pope hinted darkly that unless the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] agreed to persecute the Hussites, the church might have to call a crusade to set things right."
 DG_Hussites.009.des1: "As our new [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]ascends on the throne, he must decide our policies towards heresies. Will he continue the policies of tolerance towards heresies of his predecessor or build his own path?"

 DG_Hussites.010.desc: "With the monarch's support, the Romanists began to deal with the Hussites, seizing churches and excommunicating priests. In response, both noble and peasant Hussites marched in protests, but the situation remained peaceful.\n\nThat changed during a march in $CAPITAL_CITY$ when a march turned into a riot. Let loose on the city, the Hussites attacked the palace, sending its defenders fleeing and seizing the throne until their demands are met. News of the riot was said to have shocked the [Root.GetAdjective] ruler into an early grave.\n\nThe death of the monarch would normally be a sad but mundane affair, but now it was anarchy as the Hussites refused to acknowledge any ruler who did not support their beliefs."

In response, both noble and peasant Hussites marched in protests, but the situation remained peaceful.\n\nThat changed during a march in $CAPITAL_CITY$ when a march turned into a riot. Let loose on the city, the Hussites attacked the palace, sending its defenders fleeing and slaughtering the hapless monarch. News of the murder shocked the countryside, further polarizing the two camps. It was now clear that the Hussites had come too far to back down.\n\nThe Hussite Wars had begun."
 DG_Hussites.012.desc: "Approaching the heir to the throne, the Hussite League announced that they would acknowledge his rule over $COUNTRY$ as long as he accepted their religious beliefs. To that end, they promulgated four articles which set out a set of demands. They demanded the right to preach Wycliffitism, separating church and state, removing the special privileges that the nobility enjoyed, and allowing worshippers to take communion in both kinds, the bread and cup of Christ. It was this last point that made the movement into a heresy, and it gave them the name 'Calixtine'.\n\nThe Hussites of $CAPITAL_CITY$ represented a moderate, even conservative reform movement made up of nobles, merchants and craftsmen who lived in urban centres. Although they were heavily influenced by Wycliffitism, they were willing to accept the church hierarchy and the monarch so long as their other demands were met. They wanted to reform the church and believed that restoring it to apostolic poverty, and giving the monarch power over it, was the way to do so. These 'Utraquists' made up the moderate camp among the Hussites."
 DG_Hussites.013.desc: "The Hussite movement began in universities, but it quickly spread to the fields and farms of $COUNTRY$. Ordinary peasants were attracted to Wycliffite criticism of the church's luxuries and corruption and eagerly took up the call to share in both bread and wine of communion, seeing it as an issue of equality. For many, however, the doctrines of the Hussite League simply did not go far enough. They were Millenarians who believed that the Kingdom of God was upon them, and they wanted to establish it through force if necessary. They did not want merely to reform the church, they wanted to start from scratch. The radicals demanded equality for all, sharing private property, putting an end to rents, abolishing laws that differentiated between classes, and getting rid of the clergy altogether, replacing them with unpaid, elected leaders.\n\nThese radicals were soon driven out of the towns by their neighbours. Seeking a place of refuge, they founded a new settlement along a river, calling it 'Tabor' after the mountain upon which Jesus Christ was prophesied to return to Earth. These Taborites, and similar groups, made up the radical wing of the Hussite movement - fanatical, desperate and numerous."
 DG_Hussites.014.desc: "Followers of the Hussite heresy have begun approaching our Catholic subjects in $PROVINCENAME$, seeking to spread their beliefs. They have made some inroads, especially among the nobility, who have formed a kind of Confederation with the goal of spreading their faith.\n\nHussites began as a reform movement in Catholicism, seeking to eradicate church corruption by returning it to a state of apostolic poverty, subordinate to the secular powers. This made it popular, both amongst the aristocracy and the peasantry. However, it quickly grew beyond reform into clear heresy, denying the authority of the pope, declaring communion to be symbolic, and seeking biblical support for church doctrines."
 DG_Hussites.015.desc: "With the heir to [Root.GetAdjective] Crown unwilling to accept the Articles of $CAPITAL_CITY$, the Hussites cast about for legitimacy. The Utraquists especially did not intend to start a revolution, and the lack of a monarch was creating conflict both within and outside of $COUNTRY$.\n\nSeeking a ruler who would support the Hussites, the Utraquists made overtures to the royal houses of Europe. Eventually, they found a candidate who promised to allow them to practise their religion and offered the crown to him. Without control of $CAPITAL$, the Catholic heir to the throne could do little to prevent this usurpation. Fleeing, he vowed to take the case to pope and emperor."
 DG_Hussites.016.desc: "Suffering from a War of Religion, one of our neighbours has lost control of his throne. The Hussite rebels have successfully kept him from being crowned, and are seeking to place their own candidate on the throne. They have turned to us for legitimacy, choosing a prince from a cadet line of our dynasty and offering to place him on their throne as long as he promises not to persecute their faith.\n\nWhile this is a tempting offer, it comes with strings attached. Accepting would be like receiving our crown from the gutter; it would send a message to the other crowned heads of Europe that we support this kind of revolution. In addition, it could conceivably create a rival for our own throne, in the same way that the Duke of Normandy became a rival to the King of France.\n\nWorse than anything else, though, is the news that our royal cousin has already accepted the offer, and is already on his way there as we speak..."

The Hussite rebels have successfully kept him from being crowned, and are seeking to place their own candidate on the throne. They have turned to us for legitimacy, choosing a prince from a cadet line of our dynasty and offering to place him on their throne as long as he promises not to persecute their faith.\n\nHearing this news, our cousin gladly accepted the offer - only to be slain while trying to seize it. While he was doing so without our permission, we still cannot countenance this act of regicide."
 DG_Hussites.018.desc: "With a $MONARCHTITLE$ appointed by the Utraquists sitting on the throne, the violence in $COUNTRY$ died down. $MONARCH$ had the support of the Utraquists and the moderate Taborites, who were willing to accept [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] as long as $RULER_S_PRONOUN$ promised to tolerate the Hussite religion. $RULER_S_PRONOUN$ also had the support of moderate Catholics, who were willing to accept [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] as long as $RULER_S_PRONOUN$ promised not to convert to it. Radicals on both sides continued to shed blood, but as long as the $MONARCHTITLE$ could perform this balancing act, peace would return to $COUNTRY$."
 DG_Hussites.019.desc: "Although they had de facto control over their nation, the Hussites were not the legal authority. That lay in the hands of the pope and the emperor, who were upset to see them act as if they were. It was also a bad precedent to allow rebels and heretics to choose their own ruler. Catholic rulers nearby began to push for a Catholic ruler appointed by the pope to be placed on the throne. $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ had to decide just how much to push back against such pressure."
 DG_Hussites.020.desc: "The $PRIMARY_CULTURE$ war of religion left $COUNTRY$ war-torn and exhausted, but it failed to restore unity to the nation. Instead, the end of the war acted as a kind of intermission, giving both sides a chance to reinforce and re-arm. As long as the nation could walk a fine line between favouring either side, war was averted, with the chance of a lasting peace. But $MONARCH$ changed that balance, and in $YEAR$ $COUNTRY$ once again descended into civil war.\n\nAlready exhausted from the fighting, it seemed like this war would bring an end to $COUNTRY$'s religious troubles at last...one way or another."
 DG_Hussites.021.desc: "$COUNTRY$ was exhausted by war. Needing to continue the fight and frustrated by the aid the Romanists were getting from Catholic neighbours, the Taborites began to launch raids into nearby lands. These so-called 'Beautiful Rides' raided farms and villages for supplies, burned down churches and monasteries, and attacked Catholic forces when they met. Although the raids helped the Hussite war effort stay alive, it cost their reputation greatly. Although they remained devoted to their faith, they were now seen as little more than brigands by the rest of Europe."

Although the raids helped the Hussite war effort stay alive, it cost their reputation greatly. Although they remained devoted to their faith, they were now seen as little more than brigands by the rest of Europe."
 DG_Hussites.023.desc: "Many nobles joined the Hussite cause in $COUNTRY$. Some, however, were not so much true believers as much as opportunists. The Hussites espoused the idea of apostolic poverty, and the impoverished aristocracy was quick to see practical applications: they converted, then seized the rich monasteries and benefices that made up as much as a third of all land in $COUNTRY$. As the war dragged on, some showed a willingness to confess their sins and become good Catholics again - so long as they could keep their new lands, over the strenuous protests of the church."
 DG_Hussites.024.desc: "The Hussite Wars caused immense destruction in $COUNTRY$. Farms were abandoned, put to the torch or trampled by armies, their produce seized to feed rival armies. Foreign mercenaries and crusaders committed atrocities, and peasants rose up against their lords. By $YEAR$ both sides lay exhausted, yet neither had won a complete victory. Even the papacy, shocked at the news, seemed willing to make concessions.\n\nMeeting at the assembly of $CAPITAL_CITY$, the factions in the war met to try and forge a lasting compromise. In the end, the Romanists agreed to give the right to partake in both the bread and wine of communion and allowed public preaching of Wycliffitism. In return, the Hussites would recognise the pope's authority to appoint priests and would swear loyalty to the Catholic heir, who in return would swear an oath of loyalty to protect the rights of the burghers, Hussites and Catholics. Extremists on both sides rejected the deal and walked out, but moderates agreed to the compromise, setting the stage for a lasting peace."
 DG_Hussites.025.desc: "The Hussite Wars were long and hard, and in the end neither side could claim victory. A compromise of sorts was hammered out in which the Hussites would acknowledge the authority of the pope, while the Hussites would be allowed to preach and to partake in both kinds of host during communion. This compact had resulted in an end to the wars, but it was a bad precedent. By allowing one heresy to survive, even thrive, it sent a message to others who considered disobeying the pope and breaking the church. Perhaps it has outlived its usefulness?"
 DG_Hussites.026.desc: "The pope has declared the Compact of $CAPITAL_CITY$ to be heretical, demanding that we once again persecute the Hussites living in $COUNTRY$. This is a sore spot in our country, so recently torn up by civil war. However, it is true that times have changed. Is it worth infuriating heretics to stay in the good graces of the church?"

However, the church soon found that its authority in [Root.GetName] was limited without the support of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. Ironically, one of the chief tenets of Wycliffitism was the idea that the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], not the pope, should be the head of the church in [Root.GetName].\n\nDispleased with the situation, the pope sent a strongly worded missive to [Root.Monarch.GetName], demanding that $RULER_S_PRONOUN$ do $RULER_ADJ$ Christian duty and reinstate Catholic priests loyal to [the_vatican.GetCapitalName] while excommunicating the heretics and placing them on trial - something that should have been done years ago!  The pope hinted darkly that unless the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] agreed to persecute the Wycliffites, the church might have to call a crusade to set things right."
 DG_Lollards.008.desc: "Outraged over the council's decision to ban Wycliffitism, several dozen Wycliffite barons met and declared that they rejected the council's opinion. Vowing to ask a future pope to reassess their doctrines, they agreed to work together to support it. Naming themselves after the martyr of the council, these Wycliffite lords formed a league, using their authority to appoint Wycliffite priests to their lands and allowing them to preach in public.\n\nIn response, several dozen Catholic nobles formed a 'Romanist' league, under the authority of the bishop in charge of rooting out the heresy, expelling Wycliffite priests from their benefices. Between the two, a steady trickle of refugees left [Root.GetName]. While tense, the situation remained bloodless - but that could change if the balance of power tipped to one side."

Those doctrines have been discussed time and time again leading to different schisms, the biggest one being the XI century Great Schism between Rome and Constantinople.

 dg_catholic.001.t: "Simony"
 dg_catholic.001.d: "Thanks to bequests by pious worshippers, church titles came with land and an income for their holders. By the fifteenth century, an archbishop could rival a prince in power!  Over the centuries, this resulted in nobility trafficking in church titles in order to secure the lands attached to a bishopric or two. Few peasants could afford to pay such a price, so gradually the upper echelons of the church became full of aristocrats whose sympathies lay with their own kind."
 dg_catholic.001.a: "The church is for sale"
 dg_catholic.001.b: "Send a formal protest to the Pope"
 dg_catholic.007.t: "Birth of the Conciliar Movement"
 dg_catholic.007.d: "In the early thirteenth century, some canon lawyers speculated what to do if a pope became a heretic, and concluded that ultimate power rested in the hands of the church itself, as embodied in an ecumenical council. Meant as an exercise in theory, it gained serious attention during the schism as rival popes split the church. Witnessing the election of rival popes, the unwillingness of popes to cede power, and the politics of the Curia, frustrated church leaders looked for a rival authority that could call a church council. They found one in the example of Emperor Constantine calling the Council of Nicaea, and looked to the modern example of the Holy Roman Emperor to unite the church.\n\nMany church leaders and laity became convinced that church councils were not only good, but necessary. Rather than be led by popes with human frailties, they believed that the whole church should meet on a regular basis. Inevitably, this Conciliar movement would come into conflict with the popes, who guarded their authority jealously."

 dg_catholic.031.t: "Missionary Funding"
 dg_catholic.031.d: "One of the strengths of the Catholic church was its missionary drive. There were always new frontiers for missionaries to explore and convert in Europe. Later, the discovery of pagans in the New World and new strains of heresy at home demanded a response from the church. At times the pope called for a tithe from Catholic princes to help pay for this missionary work."

 dg_catholic.031.c: "Refuse to pay"
 dg_catholic.036.t: "Papal Legate Arrives in $CAPITAL$"
 dg_catholic.036.d: "For centuries the Catholic church struggled with secular rulers for supremacy in the Investiture controversy. The victor would gain the right to appoint bishops to their benefices, which meant having the loyalty of the clergy as well as the tithes paid by them. In the early modern era, rulers also began restricting the privileges of the clergy. All this was a thorn in the side of the papacy, and popes spent a great deal of effort trying to convince the $MONARCHTITLE$ to restore papal sovereignty over $COUNTRY$. Despite these entreaties, most countries who introduced state control over the church chose to keep it."

 dg_catholic.038.t: "Forbidden Books"
 dg_catholic.038.d: "Heresy often spread in the form of pamphlets and books in the hands of radicals. In response to this the Catholic Church established an index of forbidden books. At first the list contained only theological treatises, but as time went on it grew to include humanist philosophy, political tracts and even racy novels. Forbidden books could often be obtained despite the laws, smuggled into Catholic countries with their price driven up dramatically. It was not unheard of for a book to rise in value ten times once it was put on a list!  The ban hurt the fledgling publishing industry in Catholic countries and drove some authors to leave for more tolerant countries, but it also slowed down the advance of heresy."

 dg_catholic.041.d: "The invasion of $COUNTRY$ by infidels was a grave threat to Christianity. As in ages past, there was always the option of calling on fellow Christians for aid against an un-Christian enemy. Both individuals and rulers could heed the call to crusade and come to aid us - but crusaders were also known for being both fickle and ineffective, and Catholic nations were tired of holy war. Some among our advisors are desperate enough to risk it, though."
 dg_catholic.041.a: "Ask the pope for help"
 dg_catholic.041.b: "We can fight them ourselves"
 dg_catholic.042.t: "Christian Crusade Against $COUNTRY$"
 dg_catholic.042.d: "The Christian pope held little secular power. However, when Christendom was threatened by a powerful enemy, the pope could call a crusade against them, summoning thousands of fanatical Catholics from across Europe to heed the call and take up arms against an infidel. My lord, we are now the target of such a crusade. We are unsure what to expect - if a powerful ruler takes up the cross we might face a difficult fight, but if support is scattered, we might not even notice it."
 dg_catholic.042.a: "We shall see just how strong this pope is"
 dg_catholic.043.t: "Call to Crusade"
 dg_catholic.043.d: "Although the great crusades ended in the thirteenth century, the practise was revived again in the fifteenth century when Europe itself was invaded by infidels and when heresy threatened to emerge.\n\nWhen the pope called for a crusade, Christian princes were invited to lend their swords to fight for the true faith. Especially pious lords and those near the conflict took up arms, but most sent token forces or ignored the calls entirely. As it became apparent that the crusades were failing to have the success they had had in the past, fewer and fewer princes were willing to heed the call. Yet perhaps the age of crusades was not yet spent..."

 dg_catholic.044.d: "Our cries for help have been answered. The pope has called a crusade against our enemies!  However, we should not rejoice yet; it is unclear just how much effect this will have, or whether aid will reach us in time. We must be prepared to fight the enemy alone...and pray that others heed this call to arms."
 dg_catholic.044.a: "Now we will see who our friends really are"
 dg_catholic.045.t: "Crusade Denied"
 dg_catholic.045.d: "Our pleas for aid have fallen on deaf ears. In his arrogance, the pope has refused to call a crusade to aid us in our struggle. We now face the fury of the heathen by ourselves. Our people suffer so that others can live in peace...for now."
 dg_catholic.045.a: "Fine!  We will fight by ourselves!"
 dg_catholic.046.t: "Crusaders Arrive in $CAPITAL_CITY$"
 dg_catholic.046.d: "Having heard the pope's call to arms, thousands of men have taken up the cross and come to our aid against the enemy. However, arriving in $CAPITAL_CITY$, the crusaders are not an impressive lot. Not all are holy men; although many joined the crusade for noble reasons, others simply hoped to win a fortune, and some were even escaping justice at home. All of them caused problems: the fanatics who arrived could be upset at what they saw as a lack of piety; the opportunists expected to pillage when they won victories - even when liberating Christians; the ones escaping justice at home believed they had dispensation for any crimes from the pope - past or future. Worse yet, not all the crusaders were trained or equipped for the rigours of war, and some arrived expecting to be equipped at state expense. Despite all these problems, they were welcomed in the desperate struggle against the infidel."
 dg_catholic.046.a: "Keep them on a tight rein."
 dg_catholic.046.b: "Let them loose against the enemy."
 dg_catholic.046.c: "Accept their donations to the cause."
 dg_catholic.047.t: "Crusade Ends Prematurely"
 dg_catholic.047.d: "The death of the pope has abruptly ended the crusade called to aid us against the infidel. Without his active support for our cause, the crusade has no champion able to unite Christendom against a common enemy, and with the church meeting for a papal conclave, there is no authority to ask for another crusade. If only he had lived a little longer!"
 dg_catholic.047.a: "We are alone now."
 dg_catholic.048.t: "Crusade of $PROVINCENAME$ Ends"
 dg_catholic.048.d: "With $COUNTRY$ at peace and $PROVINCENAME$ still in Christian hands the crusade was deemed a success. Most surviving crusaders returned to their homes with tales of valour and battle against the infidel."
 dg_catholic.048.a: "Praise God!"
 dg_catholic.049.t: "Crusade Ends in Defeat"
 dg_catholic.049.d: "Our well-meant crusade against the infidel has failed to keep Christian lands out of enemy hands. Dispirited, the surviving crusaders returned to their homes with tales of woe and tragedy."
 dg_catholic.049.a: "God's plans are inscrutable."
 dg_catholic.052.t: "Ecumenical Council Called"
 dg_catholic.052.d: "The Catholic church had a tradition of calling church-wide councils to decide divisive issues. When a firm decision or reforms were needed, a council could be called in which hundreds of church leaders would meet, debate and vote. Because these councils were so important to the church, they were also highly political, and months could pass as countries sought to find a suitably neutral location to host the council."
 dg_catholic.052.a: "Offer to host the council in $PROVINCECAPITAL$."
 dg_catholic.052.b: "Suggest an alternative."
 dg_catholic.052.d2: "\nThe [council_site.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] of [council_site.Owner.GetName] has proposed that we hold the council in [council_site.GetCapitalName]."
 dg_catholic.053.t: "[council_site.GetCapitalName] Proposed as Council Site"
 dg_catholic.053.a: "It is acceptable to us"
 dg_catholic.053.b: "Refuse to attend this council"
 dg_catholic.054.t: "Unsuitable Council Site"
 dg_catholic.054.d: "More than anything else, church councils had the potential to cause dramatic changes to church doctrine - and therefore, no Catholic nation could afford to ignore them. Although in theory secular princes had no say over the affairs of the church, in practise their cooperation was essential for a council to be called without casting doubt on its legitimacy. This meant that it was crucial to find a site that was acceptable to the great powers - or at least not in thrall to their enemies. Unfortunately, this could be difficult in times of strife. The planned council in [council_site.GetName] has been called off amidst threats, boycotts and allegations."
 dg_catholic.054.a: "Politics should have no place in the church!"
 dg_catholic.055.t: "The Council of [council_site.GetCapitalName] Begins"
 dg_catholic.055.d: "At a time when it was unusual to travel far from home, church councils represented an almost unprecedented event involving hundreds of bishops from across Europe. It could take months to negotiate a neutral site, send invitations, and prepare for the council to begin. Now, however, all that hard work has come to fruition as the Council of [council_site.GetName] begins."
 dg_catholic.055.a: "Now the real work begins"
 dg_catholic.056.t: "Council of [council_site.GetCapitalName] Begins"
 dg_catholic.056.d: "A general church council has begun!  Bishops and cardinals from across Christendom are meeting to discuss and debate fine points of theology and reform the church. Bringing together hundreds of learned and important men can lead to great changes - or to hot air. The council will only meet for so long; what should our delegates try to introduce into the council?"
 dg_catholic.056.a: "Send them without instructions"
 dg_catholic.056.b: "Depose the anti-popes and mend the schism"
 dg_catholic.056.c: "Try to reform simony"

 dg_catholic.056.o: "Deal with the issues raised by the Reformation"
 dg_catholic.057.t: "Council of [council_site.GetCapitalName] Ends in Deadlock"
 dg_catholic.057.d: "General church councils involved hundreds of bishops from across Christendom meeting in a neutral location to discuss fine points of doctrine. The logistics of a single session were mind-boggling and progress at councils was slow. It should come as no surprise, then, that councils could drag out for years without resolving an issue. When all hope of compromise died, the Council of [council_site.GetCapitalName] was adjourned, in the hope that a later council with different delegates could decide what these could not."
 dg_catholic.057.a: "Nothing was accomplished"
 dg_catholic.058.t: "The Council of [council_site.GetCapitalName] Concludes"
 dg_catholic.058.d: "Church councils were one of the most democratic and powerful instruments of the Catholic church. The advantage of councils was that they allowed bishops to raise issues and be heard by all of Christendom, but the disadvantage was that it could take months to agree on even the most basic of concepts when so many influential leaders were gathered in one place. When a church council did agree on doctrine, however, the church adopted the new policy wholeheartedly. Although there remained significant issues left to deal with, the council of $YEAR$ reached a consensus that would reverberate through the church."
 dg_catholic.058.a: "Go and spread the good news"
 dg_catholic.059.t: "The Council of [council_site.GetCapitalName] Ends Prematurely"
 dg_catholic.059.d: "Church councils hosted hundreds of bishops, archbishops and cardinals from across Christendom. These 'princes of the church' were among the most powerful men in Europe, as well as the most sacrosanct. Despite this, war, disease and heresy occasionally threatened a council site. When this happened, the council often chose to adjourn and meet again at some later date in a different location. \nIn $YEAR$, the Council of [council_site.GetCapitalName] was adjourned early."
 dg_catholic.059.a: "We have failed to protect them"
 dg_catholic.061.t: "$MONARCH$'s Shame"
 dg_catholic.061.d: "Rulers used to having no checks to their authority were sometimes abused of that notion when they violated scripture. To divorce a barren wife, execute a troublesome priest, allow torture of Catholic subjects or bury a child who had committed suicide were all sins that even a $MONARCHTITLE$ had to pay for. When this happened, special dispensation was needed from the only higher authority there was: the pope. Only then would pious Catholics again respect $MONARCH$ as God's agent on Earth."
 dg_catholic.061.a: "Wait for the scandal to die down"
 dg_catholic.062.t: "Scandal Abates"
 dg_catholic.062.d: "No matter how scandalously a ruler behaved, eventually all was forgotten as time passed and new scandals arose."
 dg_catholic.062.a: "Finally!"
 dg_catholic.063.t: "Dispensation Granted"
 dg_catholic.063.d: "Our confessor reports good news!  His holiness has been convinced of $MONARCH$'s repentance and has publicly granted us absolution for our sins. This will go a long way toward restoring our good name among our Catholic subjects."
 dg_catholic.063.a: "Our good name is restored"
 dg_catholic.064.t: "Dispensation under Consideration"
 dg_catholic.064.d: "Our confessor reports that $MONARCH$'s case for dispensation is going nowhere at the Holy See. Arguments - some real, some fabricated - have been presented on both sides, with neither able to convince the tribunal of their cause. While this is not good news, it lends us hope that the case might be reopened in the future with a better result. Should that not happen, we can still make a new case should either the pope or the $MONARCHTITLE$ pass away."
 dg_catholic.064.a: "All we can do now is wait and hope"
 dg_catholic.065.t: "Dispensation Denied"
 dg_catholic.065.d: "Our confessor brings bad news from the Holy See: his holiness has turned down $MONARCH$'s request for dispensation, declaring that the $MONARCHTITLE$ has not shown proper repentance. Already rumours are spreading that the decision might have been influenced by our enemies, but only the pope himself knows the truth. This rebuke is sadly final - at least as long as he and $MONARCH$ still live. After that, we will be able to make a new case for dispensation. Should we wish to gain his blessings at that time, we would be well advised to mend our fences with both the Papal States and our fellow Catholic princes."
 dg_catholic.065.a: "Damnation!"
 dg_catholic.066.t: "Excommunication"
 dg_catholic.066.d: "Those who sinned against the church and failed to repent were shunned by it. When a ruler sinned against the church, $RULER_ADJ$ entire nation could be placed under interdict - a dire fate when every country obeyed the pope, but less effective when some broke ranks with the Vatican. Although it was occasionally abused by popes, the power to excommunicate a ruler was great indeed.\n"
 dg_catholic.066.a: "Suffer this condemnation"
 dg_catholic.066.b: "Return Rome to its bishop"
 dg_catholic.066.c: "End our shameful alliance"
 dg_catholic.066.e: "Withdraw from the Papal States"

 dg_catholic.066.g: "Switch allegiance to the other Pope"
 dg_catholic.067.t: "A Warning from the Pope"
 dg_catholic.067.d: "A papal nuncio has arrived with grim news: he is considering placing our nation under interdict!  His holiness is giving us a few years to change our ways, but after that there is a very real chance that we will suffer excommunication.\n"
 dg_catholic.067.a: "Consider the implications"
 dg_catholic.070.d: "Those who sinned against the church and failed to repent were shunned by it. When a ruler sinned against the church, $RULER_ADJ$ entire nation could be placed under interdict - a dire fate when every country obeyed the pope, but less effective when some broke ranks with the Vatican. This power was occasionally abused by the pope, but at other times excommunications held complete moral authority.\n\nIn $YEAR$ the pope placed $COUNTRY$ under interdict for openly breaking with the church and embracing heresy.\n\nCatholic countries are now likely to shun us and may even take the opportunity to invade!  Our Catholic subjects will be unhappy about this."
 dg_catholic.075.d: "Those who sinned against the church and failed to repent were shunned by it. When a ruler sinned against the church, $RULER_ADJ$ entire nation could be placed under interdict - a dire fate when every country obeyed the pope, but less effective when some broke ranks with the Vatican. This power was occasionally abused by the pope, but at other times excommunications held complete moral authority.\n\nIn $YEAR$ the pope placed $COUNTRY$ under interdict for heresy. This false charge is clearly politically motivated!\n\nCatholic countries are now likely to shun us and may even take the opportunity to invade!  We can lift the interdict by requesting dispensation, and our confessor tells us that the case against us is weak."
 dg_catholic.076.t: "Consanguinity"
 dg_catholic.076.d: "For both moral and physical reasons, the church forbade marriage to those within seven degrees of separation from each other - as distant as third cousins. This encouraged villagers to travel and marry in other areas and helped avoid many hereditary defects, but it was also quite complex to keep track of genealogy, so the rule resulted in many broken engagements and annulled marriages. Over the last few months, our ambassadors have worked tirelessly to arrange a royal marriage between a prince of our nation and a princess of one of our neighbours in the hopes of cementing good relations with them. Our work has borne fruit, and the engagement was announced, only to discover the couple is distantly related by blood. The church usually offered dispensation to such couples, but it meant acknowledging the authority of the pope."
 dg_catholic.076.a: "Ask the pope for dispensation"
 dg_catholic.076.b: "Break off the engagement"
 dg_catholic.077.t: "Broken Engagement"
 dg_catholic.077.d: "Over the last few months, our ambassadors have worked tirelessly to arrange a royal marriage between a princess of our own nation and a prince of one of our neighbours in the hopes of cementing good relations with them. Our work has borne fruit, and the engagement was announced - only to be broken off!  This public insult is something we shall remember for a long time."
 dg_catholic.077.a: "This is a slap in the face!"
 dg_catholic.078.t: "Dispensation Granted"
 dg_catholic.078.d: "The Catholic church was not inflexible. It routinely granted dispensation (special permission) to couples who wanted to join in holy matrimony but were banned by canon law, unless there was a pressing reason not to. This was true even more for rulers, who could and did exert special influence on the church...both to encourage dispensation and to deny it. In this case, his holiness has publicly granted dispensation for our engagement to go forward, and now nothing stands in the way of closer relations between our two countries."
 dg_catholic.078.a: "Arrange a royal wedding in $CAPITAL_CITY$."
 dg_catholic.079.t: "Dispensation Denied"
 dg_catholic.079.d: "Our confessor brings bad news from the Holy See: the pope has turned down our request for dispensation, and the royal wedding we planned must now be embarrassingly called off. This news is all the more vexing because it is so unusual: the church usually granted dispensation (special permission) to couples who wanted to marry unless there was a pressing reason not to...especially when they belonged to the royal courts of Europe. While the Vatican cited moral and health hazards inherent in the proposed union, we suspect that it may have been politically motivated."
 dg_catholic.079.a: "Cover up our private shame"
 dg_catholic.079.b: "Protest this rank injustice"
 dg_catholic.080.t: "[From.GetName] Has Been Placed under Interdict"
 dg_catholic.080.d: "A papal nuncio has arrived in $CAPITAL_CITY$ with the news that after all attempts at reconciliation failed, the [From.Monarch.GetTitle] of [From.GetName] has been excommunicated. Pious Catholic rulers are tasked with shunning or invading excommunicated nations. Rulers less concerned with the rules of the church might consider turning the situation to their advantage by taking one side against the other.\n\nWorshippers who acted against the tenets of the Catholic church were excommunicated from it. This was a process that began with a private condemnation, then if the behaviour persisted a public shaming, and ultimately being shunned by the church. When a ruler sinned against the church, however, [From.Monarch.GetHerHis] entire country could pay the price."

 dg_catholic.086.a: "This is a grave insult"
 dg_catholic.087.t: "Divorce Proceedings"
 dg_catholic.087.d: "The ruler of [From.GetName] has unilaterally decided to set aside his lawfully wedded spouse - a member of house $DYNASTY$. This shocking move will harm relations between our two nations."
 dg_catholic.088.t: "Marriage Declared Valid"
 dg_catholic.088.d: "After consultation with the Holy Father over our royal marriage with [From.GetName], the marriage has been declared to be valid after all. This spares us the humiliation of having a member of house $DYNASTY$ return to $CAPITAL_CITY$ in shame, although it may make for a stilted relationship."
 dg_catholic.088.a: "The honour of house $DYNASTY$ has been upheld"
 dg_catholic.091.t: "Rival Popes"
 dg_catholic.091.d: "Two rival popes claim to be the true leader of the Catholic church, both condemning the other as an anti-pope. Catholic nations are declaring their allegiance to one or the other, some out of piety, others for political gain. The longer this schism grows, the bloodier it will get. It would be best to end it quickly, either by a church council or by forcing one pope to submit through force of arms."
 dg_catholic.091.a: "Support the pope in Rome"
 dg_catholic.091.b: "Support the rival pope"
 dg_catholic.092.t: "Schism Rends the Church Asunder"
 dg_catholic.092.d: "With the Curia divided between factions supporting Rome and factions supporting $FROMCOUNTRY$, the pope made the decision to turn his back on $FROMCOUNTRY$ and replace nearly half the cardinals with his own. The defrocked cardinals rejected the authority of the pope, formed a synod, and elected their own pope. Now $FROMCOUNTRY$ and their allies are supporting this new pope, while the Papal States and their allies are supporting the one in Rome, each declaring the other to be a false anti-pope. This schism is tearing the church apart as good Catholics struggle to determine which man holds the keys of Saint Peter and the authority to lead the church."
 dg_catholic.092.a: "We should pray for guidance"
 dg_catholic.093.t: "End of the Schism"
 dg_catholic.093.d: "With only one reigning pope, Catholics can once again breathe a sigh of relief and throw their support unanimously behind him. The schism is over. Long live the pope!"

 dg_catholic.114.t: "Church Reforms"
 dg_catholic.114.d: "Over the centuries, the Catholic church faced many issues never dreamt of by the apostles. When these issues grew pressing enough, the bishops of the church would meet with the pope to debate the matter. After deciding on a course of action, the church would disseminate the new doctrine throughout the church.\n\nOne of the biggest criticisms of the church was simony, or paying bribes in return for receiving a benefice. The practise had crept into the church since Clement V and excluded peasants from the upper ranks of the church.

 dg_catholic.114.a: "The will of the church has been made clear to us"
 dg_catholic.115.d: "Over the centuries, the Catholic church faced many issues never dreamt of by the apostles. When these issues grew pressing enough, the bishops of the church would meet with the pope to debate the matter. After deciding on a course of action, the church would disseminate the new doctrine throughout the church.\n\nOne such issue was indulgences. Originally given as unexpected thanks for donations desperately needed by the church, by $YEAR$ they had evolved into a way of making money for the papacy.

 dg_catholic.116.d: "Over the centuries, the Catholic church faced many issues never dreamt of by the apostles. When these issues grew pressing enough, the bishops of the church would meet with the pope to debate the matter. After deciding on a course of action, the church would disseminate the new doctrine throughout the church.\n\nNew priests were given a benefice from the church to provide them with an income while doing God's work, but in return were expected to pay their first year's income, or 'annate', to the church. This provided bishops with an income, which made the position more lucrative and more tempting for noble sons, but it also increased the poverty of the average priest and so drove educated middle-class men away from priesthood. Since the bishops themselves also paid the annate, it also encouraged bishops to tax the peasants on their land heavily, leading many peasants to see the church as no better than any other baron or duke. In $YEAR$ the church officially abolished the practise of paying the annate.\n\nThis will significantly cut down on simony events."
 dg_catholic.117.d: "Over the centuries, the Catholic church faced many issues never dreamt of by the apostles. When these issues grew pressing enough, the bishops of the church would meet with the pope to debate the matter. After deciding on a course of action, the church would disseminate the new doctrine throughout the church.\n\nAlthough priests were supposed to be literate theologians, the average parish priest was uneducated and often did not even know how to read Latin. It was not unheard of for priests to simply mumble their way through the mass, with their congregation equally unaware he was not speaking the right words!  Obviously these priests were also unlikely to make good preachers, and religious education in general suffered. Not only was this incompetence, it could lead to outright heresy.\n\nIn $YEAR$ the church set out clear rules and standards for clerical education and began establishing seminaries across Europe for that purpose.\n\nThis will significantly cut down on absenteeism events."

When these issues grew pressing enough, the bishops of the church would meet with the pope to debate the matter. After deciding on a course of action, the church would disseminate the new doctrine throughout the church.\n\nThe nobility often saw bishoprics as sinecures for their landless sons rather than actual professions, and would secure a bishopric for their sons to ensure he had an income. Wealthy families sometimes paid for two or more benefices for the same man - often leagues apart. This helped raise their standard of living, but of course no one man could live in two places at the same time. In many cases they appointed a salaried replacement who was simply not up to the duties required. Despite frequent condemnation of this practise, it was only in $YEAR$ that strict rules against pluralism were put in place.\n\nThis will significantly cut down on absenteeism events."

Technically priests were not supposed to have children since they were celibate, but it was all too common for a priest or bishop to keep a concubine, and then introduce their children as nephews and nieces who could not inherit their father's estates directly, so instead received church positions or favours. In $YEAR$ the church took steps to end this practise, which had become endemic in the upper ranks of the church.\n\nThis will significantly cut down on nepotism and bishop's mistress events."

 dg_catholic.141.d: "The Society of Jesus had two purposes: to wipe out heresy at home, and to bring the gospel abroad. The order specialised in working among foreign civilisations in Asia and America; Jesuit monks learned the local language, translated texts into $PRIMARY_CULTURE$ and brought Western ideas to local rulers. They hoped their efforts would spread Christianity, but their missions also helped open relations with their homelands - as long as they were tolerated.

Instead, it was often the black-robed Jesuit monks who became the ambassadors of the West.\n\nBelieving that other faiths might also reflect God's purpose, these monks made an effort to learn local languages and adopt local dress and customs.

They spent years learning the local languages, even going so far as to publish dictionaries in these tongues. They also showed off their learning and offered free schooling to the children of elites in the hopes of gaining powerful converts.\n\nDespite these tactics, their efforts bore few fruits. One of the reasons for this was their limited numbers: it took two years to train a missionary, and a third of the volunteers died on the ocean journey to $COUNTRY$.

The so-called Black Robes made a great effort to blend in with local customs, respect cultural and religious practises, learn the language and model themselves after the local elites. Later missionaries belonged to the rival Dominican and Franciscan orders of monks. They resented Jesuit influence and considered their methods to be heretical and their upper class targets to be against the example of Christ. They reacted by aggressively proselytizing among the lower classes and actively opposing local customs, attacking temples and making outrageous demands. Their actions were met with a mixture of shock and anger. Soon outraged locals were beating and killing Christians in response, and blood ran down the streets."

In other countries it was ushered in from above as kings and princes converted the state for reasons of their own. This kind of magisterial Reformation was the most likely to succeed in the long run because it enjoyed the support of the powers that be, but kings could not afford to neglect the will of the people completely. A disputation, or formal debate, was a traditional way to resolve religious differences within the Catholic church, and some rulers sponsored one, scouring the land for reformers and proponents of the church to hold a public disputation. Depending on who was appointed to each side, disputations could be fiery, or they could be decided before it even began."

With the introduction of the Reformation to $COUNTRY$, its purpose for existence came into doubt. Before enemies could take advantage of this doubt, $MONARCH$ took control of the situation by declaring $COUNTRY$ to be a secular nation, and himself its ruler.

Sometimes, a spouse could be old, ugly, a drunkard, or just plain mean. Rulers trapped in such loveless marriages generally had few options - they could seek a divorce from the pope and risk both a scandal and alienating their spouse's powerful family, or they could have affairs on the side and risk having bastard children that could cause problems with the succession. For $MONARCH$, however, the exciting new $COUNTRY_RELIGION$ faith offered up another option. The faith emphasised using the Bible to support theology, and in the Old Testament, several kings and patriarchs practised polygamy. This would allow the $MONARCHTITLE$ to keep their original spouse and take another legally, eliminating the problem of bastards. In a series of letters written to $THEOLOGIAN$, $MONARCH$ argued for this course of action, and, against his better judgement, $THEOLOGIAN$ reluctantly agreed that it could be done. Yet this scandal might bring great shame upon the nascent $COUNTRY_RELIGION$ church, and upon $COUNTRY$. Is it worth it to have your cake and eat it, too?"

Many rulers gradually loosened the grip of the Catholic church with a series of laws designed to weaken it and play to the strengths of Lutheranism. At the same time, rulers favoured theologians and courtiers who supported the new faith and criticised the church.

At the same time, church leaders made overtures to moderate Lutherans by deliberately defining Catholicism along liberal lines.\n\nThis renewed church welcomed Lutherans back to the fold in large numbers, but rulers often had other things to think about that pure theology.

Moderates who had been raised in the church returned gladly now that their concerns had been heard. Others saw it as too little, too late, and turned away even more from the church and declared themselves radicals.

Was communion meant to be the literal blood and body of Christ, or a symbolic sacrifice?  Did repentance precede or follow faith?  Over such questions reformers argued and riots broke out. In order to find unity, Lutheran churches established Articles of Faith that clarified their beliefs. Often, a losing side would leave the church rather than give up their doctrine. In this way, groups such as the Sacramentarians and Ubiquitarians became fertile ground for the Calvinist church to grow."

Worse, it was in faulty Latin, as proved by a recent translation that used early Greek scripture made available during the Renaissance. Early reformers attacked the church by writing translations of the Bible into the vernacular (local language), making the Bible available for every man to read and form his own opinions. These translations, however, could be tainted by the beliefs of the translator, and most were banned by the Catholic church.

During times of great upheaval witch trials could lead to mass hysteria and mob lynchings when a court found in the defendant's favour or where the law could not or would not be enforced. These witch hunts became especially common after the church council that ended the schism met in Basle, a town known for its anti-witchcraft theology.

In an attempt to create a more cohesive faith, Lutheran countries went through the process of codifying books of theology and prayer that were considered to be canon. This established a single, unifying set of beliefs that helped establish the church against the inroads that Catholics were attempting to make.

With the efforts of the Catholic church to eradicate corruption and clarify doctrine, some reformers felt that a compromise could be made. The pope was not God's chosen leader, but perhaps he could be seen as a fallible leader chosen by pious men. The mass was not a Lutheran service, but perhaps it could be seen as a holy sacrifice in its own way.

This gave the movement tremendous appeal among Catholics during the Reformation, but it had unexpected side effects. Over time, generations of Lutherans applied reason to holy scripture and began to lose faith in the church. This process was different in each country. In some, the church gradually became impotent, with the common man looking into spiritualism and the occult to satisfy his hunger for faith. In some, revival movements sprang up to combat this trend. In the rest, the governments passed laws designed to keep the state church's influence strong."

 dg_protestant.046.d: "With the end of the Lutheran Reformation, Lutheranism lost some of its fervour. Division among Lutherans, losses against other faiths and without a place for women as nuns all contributed to a general feeling of isolation from their faith in Lutheran countries.\n\nThis was especially a problem in university towns, which were growing too rapidly for the existing church hierarchy to accommodate. Theologians and preachers cast about for ideas, especially from the Calvinist churches and Counter-Reform Jesuits who were inspiring such fervour in their own lands. A new movement called Pietism attempted to use their methods with the theology of the Church of $COUNTRY$.\n\nPreachers gave open-air sermons to the public, composed new hymns using popular music, incorporated laity in the functions of the church, and channelled activists into voluntary societies that did missionary work and enforced public morality.

Some theologians felt that the Reformation had not gone nearly far enough. These radicals rejected transubstantiation (the idea that the body and blood of Christ was present in the host) as a myth, considered baptism a contract with God that could be voided with sin, and suggested that an omniscient God implied predestination - that God knew in advance who was damned and who was saved.

 dg_reformed.002.d: "The Lutheran Reformation exposed cracks in the church, and through these cracks dozens of churches emerged. With no one authority to declare a doctrine heretical, charismatic preachers had the chance to leave a lasting impression on the nascent churches that emerged in opposition to Catholicism. Spurned by their home countries, some of these preachers arrived in neighbouring lands seeking more fertile ground for their proselytization."

 dg_reformed.002.c: "Invite him to $CAPITAL$ to show us the way"
 dg_reformed.003.t: "Religious Nationalism"
 dg_reformed.003.d: "Early Lutherans and their Catholic opponents often treated the Reformation as an issue for nobles and priests to decide, but growing literacy and an interest in religion helped spread theological issues to the middle class. Demanding a say in their church, many burghers felt the Lutheran Reformation did not go far enough. When new, subversive ideas spread - priests elected by their parishioners, the equality of all men under God - they were readily embraced by those who felt otherwise voiceless in society. This new Calvinist faith became the cornerstone of opposition to central authority for many."
 dg_reformed.003.a: "Fight this faith with words"
 dg_reformed.003.b: "Burn them at the stake"
 dg_reformed.004.t: "Radical Reformation"
 dg_reformed.004.d: "The events of the sixteenth century led to a great religious revival where Christians approached their faith on a new, personal basis. With the help of growing literacy, newly translated Bibles and the Lutheran Reformation leading the way, many peasants and burghers began to preach a fundamentalist form of Christianity. This new denomination emphasised personal responsibility, democracy and the equality of men - radical, subversive, and extremely popular among the common people."
 dg_reformed.005.t: "The [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] Confession"
 dg_reformed.005.d: "The radical, anti-establishment Calvinist Church has grown into a popular movement, attracting converts not only from the masses, but also from [Root.Culture.GetName] elites at court. In fact, they have grown so numerous and so confident that they have gathered together in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] to write a lengthy creed by which their faith can be defined."
 dg_reformed.005.reformed: "\nThis has put the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] in a precarious position - to defend the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith and root out these heretics, or to throw caution to the wind and embrace the revolution?"
 dg_reformed.005.a: "Embrace these radical new ideas"
 dg_reformed.005.b: "Arrest the heretics!"
 dg_reformed.006.d: "Although many rulers of Europe throw off their loyalty to the pope, they put themselves in his stead by seizing control of the nascent Lutheran churches that replaced the Catholic church. This made the new, radical Calvinist church and its democratic and individualistic ideas anathema to them. Because of this, Lutherans persecuted this new denomination as much or more than Catholics. It took these new reformers decades to win acceptance in Europe, but eventually their numbers forced others to grudgingly respect their faith."
 dg_reformed.006.t: "The Radical Reformation"
 dg_reformed.006.a: "The radicals have joined the mainstream"
 dg_reformed.007.t: "Congregationalists and Anabaptists"
 dg_reformed.007.d: "Although the Reformation was already well underway in $CAPITAL_CITY$, not everyone agreed that it was heading in the right direction. Some preachers saw a state church as a betrayal of the Reformation and wanted to restore the church to its original purity, free from entanglements with the government. They defined the church as made up only of people who willingly joined it, and free from government support or interference. To this end, they called for an end to enforced military service, payment of church tithes, and infant baptism, and demanded that church-goers govern themselves rather than follow a church hierarchy.\n\nAll of these were radical ideas, but the most radical of all was the idea that only adults should be baptized. By baptizing infants, not only was religious unity enforced, but civil society could better keep track of the population. To suggest otherwise was to suggest heresy - and these Congregationalists and Anabaptists were dangerously close to heresy."
 dg_reformed.007.a: "Forbid them from disseminating their views"
 dg_reformed.007.b: "It is healthy to have religious dialogue"
 dg_reformed.008.t: "The $PROVINCECAPITAL$ Confession"
 dg_reformed.008.d: "Alienated from the state churches set up by Calvinist nations, disaffected Anabaptists began spreading their ideas directly to the people. In $YEAR$, Anabaptist theologians and preachers - Mennonites, Hutterites, and many others - came together in $PROVINCECAPITAL$ to define their theology and try to find common ground.\n\nAnabaptists attempted to use scripture to set up a simple, pure church free from government interference. They believed that only willing believers should join the church and baptized members as adults when they joined rather than as infants - a practise which has no biblical support. They believed that the church and state should be separate, and that the church had no right to punish people for their religious beliefs. Anabaptists were pacifists who refused to fight - even in self-defence against the people persecuting their faith.\n\nAll this made the Anabaptists anathema to most rulers, who saw their faith as a direct attack on the state church...which in many ways, it was."
 dg_reformed.008.a: "More division in the church"
 dg_reformed.009.t: "New Jerusalem"
 dg_reformed.009.d: "The ideas of the Reformation were powerful, not only to rulers and theologians, but also to the common man. Having rejected tenets of the Catholic church that had stood for a thousand years, some reformers began to define a more fundamentalist approach to Christianity.\n\nOne reformer announced that $PROVINCECAPITAL$ had been revealed to him as the site of New Jerusalem, where the Kingdom of God would be restored on Earth. His Anabaptist followers swiftly rose up and occupied the city, re-baptizing the citizenry into their faith and expelling those who refused.\n\nThe forces of the $MONARCHTITLE$ quickly responded, leading to the movement becoming more and more radical until the bitter end, when the siege was broken and the rebels hung in cages until they starved. This single incident would forever taint the Anabaptist faith, which was otherwise a pacifist movement, and it helped to illustrate the dangers of the Reformation."

 dg_reformed.009.b: "Give in to their demands"
 dg_reformed.010.t: "Nationalism and Reformation"
 dg_reformed.010.d: "Our neighbours and cousins have embraced the Calvinist faith as a way of explaining their tragic occupation by foreigners and are making trouble for their so-called ruler. If we converted to this faith, we could harness this into a force for nationalism, transforming support for the church into support for $COUNTRY$. With our military might backing up an insurrection, we might drive off the invaders once and for all and regain lands that ought to be ours. However, this would mean turning out backs on the faith of our fathers for political gain. Could we be so Machiavellian?"
 dg_reformed.010.a: "We shall become Greater $COUNTRY$"
 dg_reformed.010.b: "Stay true to the $COUNTRY_RELIGION$ faith"
 dg_reformed.012.t: "Division among the Christians"
 dg_reformed.012.d: "In Europe the Catholic church was suffering a schism the likes of which had only been seen once before, in the eleventh century. This conflict presented others on the fringes of Christendom with a rare opportunity to divide and conquer by choosing sides - or by not intervening, to allow this 'Reformation' to sweep over the Christians in their demesne. The new doctrines were especially attractive to Christians seeking to explain how they had erred so badly that God had abandoned them to the rule of infidels, and tens of thousands eagerly converted to the new 'Calvinist' faith that was in opposition to mainstream Catholicism over the protests of local Christian leaders."
 dg_reformed.012.a: "We see no need to intervene"
 dg_reformed.012.b: "Encourage the heretics to split the church"
 dg_reformed.012.c: "Crush this movement to win the support of Catholics"
 dg_reformed.013.t: "The $PROVINCECULTURE$ Brethren"
 dg_reformed.013.d: "Believing in electing priests, scriptural proof for church doctrine and re-baptism of adults, Anabaptists horrified Catholics and moderate Lutherans alike. Worse, they were pacifists who refused to fight in armies and rejected the moral authority of monarchs, which made them inconvenient at best and traitorous at worst. Worst of all, radical Anabaptists had made a name for themselves by revolting against their ruler!\n\nFor these reasons, they were often chased out of areas like $PROVINCENAME$. Despite all this, Anabaptist churches such as the Mennonites and Hutterites made converts throughout Europe."

 dg_reformed.013.c: "Let them live in peace"
 dg_reformed.014.t: "Translated Confession"
 dg_reformed.014.d: "Alongside the Lutheran Reformation, a second movement drew followers. Calvinist preachers demanded scriptural support for everything, condemned church hierarchies and placed the congregation in charge of the election of priests. This radical reformation ate at the foundations of monarchy and the state church, and so naturally was banned from many places. However, its ideas slowly gained acceptance. In $YEAR$, a noted theologian translated the Calvinist Confession of Faith into $PRIMARY_CULTURE$, gaining support for its heretical ideas."
 dg_reformed.014.a: "Have him thrown into prison for heresy"
 dg_reformed.014.b: "Have him fined for this unauthorised work"
 dg_reformed.014.c: "Invite him to preach publicly"
 dg_reformed.015.t: "Calvinist Retaliation"
 dg_reformed.015.d: "Angered by the treatment of the translator of the Calvinist Confession, Calvinist fanatics broke into the castle of the man who ordered it and strung him up, before proceeding to barricade themselves inside the castle. Although this revolt was doomed to failure, it was a rallying cry for Calvinist partisans in $COUNTRY$, who saw it as a noble gesture."
 dg_reformed.015.a: "Hang them all"
 dg_reformed.016.t: "The Lords of the Congregation"
 dg_reformed.016.d: "A group of aristocrats named 'the Faithful Congregation of Christ Jesus in $COUNTRY$' have joined together in order to further the Calvinist faith. They have the power to raise the flag of rebellion against the $MONARCHTITLE$ - or provide [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] with much-needed support in exchange for religious toleration. This could be just what we need in the circumstances - or it could be a trap."
 dg_reformed.016.a: "Make concessions to them in return for their support"
 dg_reformed.016.b: "Summon Calvinist nobles to answer for their heresy"
 dg_reformed.017.t: "Beggar's Summons"
 dg_reformed.017.d: "Overnight, every friary in $CAPITAL_CITY$ has had an anonymous warning posted on their doors. This summons is a condemnation of monasticism, claiming that it takes alms from the needy and gives it to corrupt priests. Although nobody is claiming authorship, it is clearly the work of Calvinist missionaries and preachers in $CAPITAL$. While it has not sparked any violence, the stunt has shaken friars and nuns in $COUNTRY$, and the church is demanding we take a stand."
 dg_reformed.017.a: "Look the other way"
 dg_reformed.017.b: "Summon Calvinist preachers to answer for these crimes"
 dg_reformed.030.t: "Libri Carolini"
 dg_reformed.030.d: "$THEOLOGIAN$ has made an interesting discovery: an ancient Catholic treatise written for Charlemagne called the Libri Carolini. The book was written during a brief period in which the pope agreed with the Iconoclasm of the Orthodox church, and in it the Catholic church railed against the veneration of images as heresy - one of the ideas that the Calvinist church had been expounding for years. Although the Catholics quickly abandoned the doctrine, this book proves that our ideas are not radical after all - much to the embarrassment of the Catholic church."
 dg_reformed.030.a: "Publish it far and wide"
 dg_reformed.042.t: "The Great Awakening"
 dg_reformed.042.d: "Inspired by itinerant preachers who spoke directly to the average person, Calvinist Christians began to approach their faith in an intensely personal way. The movement emphasised personal responsibility, morality, and salvation, and having a direct relationship with God. This helped lead to a Christian revival, renewing interest in faith that had been waning, and helped spread the faith to marginalized groups who normally would not be approached for conversion: women, blacks and slaves.\n\nThe revival preached against empty ritual and hierarchy that prevented people from experiencing God themselves, and this quickly brought it into conflict with the established churches. Soon churches suffered schisms between 'New Light' revivalists who embraced the new evangelism and 'Old Light' traditionalists who wanted to keep ritual and hierarchy in their church."
 dg_reformed.042.a: "Give our support to the revivalists"
 dg_reformed.042.b: "Give our support to the traditionalists"
 dg_reformed.042.c: "Keep an eye on the situation"
 dg_reformation.001.t: "Ninety-Five Theses"
 dg_reformation.001.d: "A [reformation_origins.Culture.GetName] monk has broken his silence and publicly criticised the Church for its excesses. Writing in everyday language in place of Latin, he argued that God demanded belief, not good works in order to be saved. He then went on to point out ninety-three examples of the Church violating this principle, focusing especially on the sale of Indulgences. Some say the monk nailed his tract to the door of the [reformation_origins.GetCapitalName] church for all to see; all we can say for certain is that he sent a copy to the Archbishop of [reformation_origins_archbishop.GetName]."
 dg_reformation.001.a: "Pass it along to the Pope"

 dg_reformation.001.c: "Send a legate to show the monk the error of his ways"

 dg_reformation.001.owner: "\nEither way, this dispute is no matter for the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle]."
 dg_reformation.001.pope: "\nThe tract is an open attack on the authority of the Pope himself and verging on heresy. We must act, lest hot headed reformers be lured into heresy."
 dg_reformation.001.princes: "\nIn its plainspoken vernacular, the tract has struck a chord among Catholics upset with the excesses of the Church and frustrated with the slow pace of reform. It has already begun circulating among [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]."
 dg_reformation.003.t: "Support for Reform"
 dg_reformation.003.d: "Day by day, support for reform of the Catholic Church grows in [Root.Country.GetName]. In inns and fields and even in churches, [Root.Culture.GetName] Catholics are beginning to openly express their support for the author of the Ninety-Five Theses and his criticism of the Church.\n\nWith evidence of corruption abounding in the Church, the monk's idea that all beliefs should be found in holy Scripture was seductively simple. With the recent translation of the Bible, ordinary Catholics could see that some of the most controversial beliefs in Christianity had no basis in Scripture...but neither did many beloved ones. Even the authority of the Pope himself stood on shaky ground when faced with such scrutiny - an intriguing thought to some rulers."
 dg_reformation.003.a: "The Church is in dire need of reform"
 dg_reformation.003.b: "This heresy threatens to break the Church"
 dg_reformation.003.early: "\nSo far, the movement is harmless - but if the Church does declare his writings to be heresy, how long will that last?"
 dg_reformation.003.excommunicated: "\nDespite the excommunication of the monk, his message remains persuasive."
 dg_reformation.004.t: "Debating Reform"
 dg_reformation.004.d: "Universities are places of debate, and the University of [Root.GetCapitalName] is no exception. The publication of the Ninety-Five Theses has led to a spirited debate among theologians there."
 dg_reformation.004.a: "As long as it remains academic..."
 dg_reformation.004.church: "\nThe debate has led to a rejection of the Theses among the students and faculty there."
 dg_reformation.004.reform: "\nThe debate has led to strong support for the Theses among the students and faculty there."
 dg_reformation.005.t: "The [reformation_origins_disputation.Capital.GetName] Disputation"
 dg_reformation.005.d: "The recent publication of the Ninety-Five Theses criticising the Church has stirred up a stinging reaction in [reformation_origins.Owner.GetName]. The Pope himself sent a representative to correct its mistakes, while its author - a [reformation_origins.Culture.GetName] monk from [reformation_origins.GetName] - was invited to give his reply. Both men believing in the righteousness of their cause, they agreed to hold a debate in [reformation_origins_disputation.GetName] Castle in view of [reformation_origins_disputation.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] [reformation_origins_disputation.Owner.Monarch.GetName], with masters from theological universities to act as neutral judges.\n\nThe debate itself lasted for weeks. The [reformation_origins.Culture.GetName] monk argued that there was no Biblical evidence that Purgatory existed and that the Pope did not have the authority to offer Indulgences. The Roman legate pressed the monk to acknowledge the authority of the Pope over the Church until finally the monk admitted that the Pope had no such authority: 'I deny that he is above scripture.'\n\nThis statement was a tacit admission of heresy, if not an outright declaration of war against the Church. In the end, neither man budged from his initial position, and both declared victory in the debate as they returned to their homes."
 dg_reformation.005.a: "Wait and see what happens"
 dg_reformation.005.b: "Excommunicate this heretic!"
 dg_reformation.006.university: "\nTheologians from our university are mulling over the debate in order to make their verdict. It may be prudent to see how the Pope reacts first, however."
 dg_reformation.007.t: "Exsurge Domine"
 dg_reformation.007.d: "The Pope has sent us copies of a Papal Bull and ordered our bishops to post it in public. This is nothing new, but the reaction is!  Supporters of the [reformation_origins.Culture.GetName] monk who posted the Ninety-Five Theses recently have begun tearing the Bull down and even attacking the priests who post it!\n\nThe Bull - named after its opening phrase, Arise O Lord (Exsurge Domine) announces that the Ninety-Five Theses are in fact heresy, and gives its author sixty days to recant or face excommunication from the Church. Until now, the monk could claim to be trying to reform the Church from within. Now, however, it leaves him with a stark choice: abandon his beliefs or his Church. Which way will he and his followers decide?  The riots so far suggest the answer."
 dg_reformation.007.a: "Send soldiers to protect the priests"
 dg_reformation.007.b: "Do not intervene in ecclesiastical matters"
 dg_reformation.007.luther: "Indeed, it comes as no surprise when he publicly gave his answer: to call the Bull the work of the Antichrist and burn it, to the cheers of hundreds. It seems that there is no stopping this now, and God protect [Root.GetName]."

 dg_reformation.008.d: "A cardinal of the Church has placed pressure on the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to do something about the [reformation_origins.Culture.GetName] author of the Ninety-Five Theses - either to send him to Rome for trial or to hold a trial in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName].\n\nNeither option is very attractive. Sending the reformer to Rome would mean sending him to his death - and would be seen as a betrayal by the monk's [Root.GetAdjective] supporters. Holding a trial in [Root.Country.GetName] would place the blame even more squarely on the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s shoulders. With thousands openly supporting the heretic, it would be unwise to attempt either."

While the Pope was the supreme authority over the Church, he still acted within the limits of the Church - and that meant appealing to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to punish heretics within [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] domain. To do otherwise was to suggest limits to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] authority and power as well as to potentially invite excommunication or crusades against the heretics!"

What makes this news alarming is how many peasants across [Root.GetName] have joined, brought together by their shared belief in the Reformation.\n\nWhile Princes and Burghers had listened keenly to criticisms of Papal authority and Church tithes, the peasants had been listening to an entirely different theme. Phrases such as 'All men are the same in God's eyes' and 'Good Christians do not have to obey unjust laws' were revolutionary - literally. Under Catholicism the peasants had little recourse - but if they embraced Lutheranism, they could justify revolt. The result was a revolt that stretched across dozens of provinces simultaneously, overwhelming many noble's ability to respond to it."

Asked by the peasants to lead them, he instead wrote back that they should lay down their arms. As the revolution continued his pleas turned into sermons against revolt.\n\nFinally, in [GetMonth] [GetYear] he wrote the scathing 'Against the Rioting Peasants' in which he declared that God was on the side of the Princes. He urged rulers to deal with the peasants harshly, saying that all authorities had been appointed by God to rule over them and the Church, and that resistance to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] was punishable by God.\n\nThis public declaration soured the peasants to his beliefs even as it took the life out of the revolts. At the same time, it won over many Princes to the Reformation: now the Reformation could be seen as a useful tool for the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] rather than a dangerous heresy that caused insurrection."

This disagreement gave the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] an opportunity to place [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] mark upon the nascent [Root.Religion.GetName] faith.\n\nOne of the most pressing issues was whether or not clergy should be able to marry. Many reformers argued that since early Christian bishops had been instructed to be chosen from married men, there was strong scriptural evidence to allow clerical marriage. This might also help to attract men to the profession who might otherwise be turned away from a life of enforced celibacy, helping to alleviate clerical shortages.\n\nOn the other hand, celibate priests could focus on their faith rather than their families, and also had no motivation to pass on their benefices to their sons."

This disagreement gave the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] an opportunity to place [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] mark upon the nascent [Root.Religion.GetName] faith.\n\nThis particular issue was sparked by a married couple who wish to separate - something traditionally handled by a Catholic bishop. One option would be to make divorce a legal issue, allowing couples to seek divorce from a judge. This would make divorce easy to obtain, even for the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle].\n\nA second option would be to keep divorce within the purview of the Church, allowing it only in cases where one spouse abandoned the other for a year, or in cases of proven adultery, or when a marriage was obtained under force or false pretenses. This would protect the sanctity of marriage by making it difficult to obtain a divorce.\n\nA more radical option would be to recognise that both divorce and marriage fall outside the scope of the Church, as some say was true in the early Christian Church. In this view, couples do not need to seek the blessing of the Church to marry - indeed, they need not marry to live together and have children."

Some believed that the Bible was entirely literal, and that meant the Church should be structured strictly according to the Word of God, with all other views seen as heresy.\n\nA second view stated that prayer and contemplation was needed to understand the Bible, which used metaphors and analogies at times. In this view, every man could interpret the same verse slightly differently.

In this traditional view, anyone could fall from grace, no matter how noble - and any man could be saved if he repented, no matter how sinful.\n\nA revolutionary new doctrine rejected this. If God is Omniscient, they argued, then He knows every action everyone will take before they are even born - and so He already knows whether each person will be saved or not.

The Catholic Church maintained its authority by claiming an unbroken line of succession from Saint Peter through to the current pope, from him to the bishops, and from the bishops to parish priests. In this way the pope could use the authority of the Church Fathers to exercise control over the Church.\n\nThe Catholic Church may not be the best example of a good Church, however!  Many Christians felt alienated by [the_vatican.GetCapitalName]. Why not allow each Congregation to have a say over their own church by electing their ministers and deacons?

 dg_hussite.001.t: "Criticism of the Catholic Church"
 dg_hussite.001.d: "A learned theologian at $PROVINCECAPITAL$ university has begun using his position to openly criticise the Catholic church. Breaking with tradition, he has spoken in plain English about the prevalence of simony and absenteeism in the church, of how ecclesiastical laws are protecting corrupt clerics, and how the church has begun to meddle in the affairs of $MONARCHTITLE$s. Even more boldly, he argues that the solution to these excesses is to return the church to a state of apostolic poverty by giving up its landholdings and its treasures - by force if necessary.\n\nAlready, this preacher is making waves. The best and brightest of our nobility are educated at $PROVINCECAPITAL$, and many are in agreement with the man. Not only is it plain that the church is corrupt, but also that there is much wealth and power to be gained by opposing it in $COUNTRY$. However, his words are an embarrassment to the church, and some have begun calling for his dismissal."

 dg_hussite.002.t: "Papal Bull against Wycliffitism"
 dg_hussite.002.d: "Criticism of the Catholic church was dangerous, and the church responded sharply to the anti-Catholic 'Wycliffite' tracts emanating from $COUNTRY$'s universities. The pope wrote a papal bull, listing nineteen errors in the tracts, and demanding that $COUNTRY$ do something to stop it. The bull was sent not only to church leaders in $COUNTRY$, but also to the $MONARCHTITLE$, clearly charging him with the duty to intervene in the university and condemning him for not having done so already.\n\nHowever, the bull did not go so far as to declare it heresy or excommunicate the preacher, and the $MONARCHTITLE$ saw some benefit to keeping the nobility happy and the church wary by continuing to criticise the church."

 dg_hussite.003.t: "Wycliffite Revolt"
 dg_hussite.003.d: "Taking advantage of the simmering mood of $COUNTRY$, thousands of Wycliffites have thrown their lot in with rebels and risen up in arms. Already they have murdered the Archbishop and are making demands.\n\nWycliffitism was a religious movement that condemned the excesses of the church, declared that the church should not own land, and even went so far as to argue that Christians should stop paying tithes to support corrupt priests who charged people for services. These ideas were very attractive to peasants, many of whom paid rent to the church. When a peasants revolt broke out in $YEAR$, some of their leaders were self-declared Wycliffites who saw it as a rallying cause that could unite the peasants against their landlords.\n\nThis was horrifying to the reformers who had made Wycliffitism popular and to the nobility who had embraced its anticlerical themes for political reasons. Many of them abandoned the cause, seeing in it a dangerous precedent."

 dg_hussite.003.b: "Let us not be too hasty"
 dg_hussite.004.t: "The Council of Blackfriars"
 dg_hussite.004.d: "Wycliffitism had gone from being one man's crusade to reform the church into a populist movement that wanted revolution. Now it was going further than simply demanding the church return to apostolic poverty; it also rejected traditional church doctrines like celibacy, arguing that the clergy should not be paid for their work, and should not be allowed to participate in government.\n\nThe church of $COUNTRY$ was eager to put an end to this movement, and met in council in $CAPITAL_CITY$ to weigh in on them. However, the situation in $COUNTRY$ was still delicate; although Wycliffitism had inspired revolt among the peasantry, it inspired dreams of centralising government among the nobility, and still had powerful supporters. The $MONARCHTITLE$ had to walk a careful tightrope between the church and Wycliffite supporters. One proposed solution was a compromise that would satisfy both sides: declare individual doctrines to be heretical, but not the movement or the founder. This would seriously weaken it without leading to revolt."

 dg_hussite.005.t: "Heresy at $PROVINCECAPITAL$"
 dg_hussite.005.d: "The Wycliffite preacher at $PROVINCECAPITAL$ university continues to be controversial. While continuing to condemn the excesses of the church, he now spoke out against church doctrines not based in the Bible such as confession, exorcism, and even transubstantiation. This last doctrine was a grave mistake. By declaring there to be no biblical evidence for Jesus transforming the bread and wine of the last supper into his literal body and blood, the reformer lost many of his most ardent supporters. In addition, he now was clearly guilty of heresy. It was one thing to protect a reformer from the wrath of a corrupt church, but another thing entirely to protect a heretic from the wrath of the righteous God. Something had to be done about him. Yet he was an old man, and not long for the world anyway..."

 dg_hussite.005.b: "Keep him despite the scandal"
 dg_hussite.006.t: "The Wycliffite Bible"
 dg_hussite.006.d: "For years, a Wycliffite reformer had worked tirelessly to translate the Bible from Latin, a dead language spoken rarely in $COUNTRY$, into simple $PRIMARY_CULTURE$. Even after his death, Wycliffite theologians continued this work, finally publishing a translation of the Bible in $YEAR$. This had two profound implications.\n\nFirst, the common man could now read the Bible himself - and in so doing, become able to debate theological issues with priests. Wycliffitism gained great support through this work. Secondly, the work of translation and the publishing of it were both costly. It showed that, despite everything, the Wycliffites continued to have friends in high places who were willing to bankroll the movement."

 dg_hussite.006.b: "Lend our support to this great work"
 dg_hussite.007.t: "The Wycliffite Petition"
 dg_hussite.007.d: "Wycliffitism was popular with the nobility, who saw many agreeable doctrines in it. Gathering support for their cause, a group of Wycliffite barons wrote a petition to $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$, nailing it to the door of the parliament in $CAPITAL_CITY$. They rejected the authority of the church to own land or serve in government, calling for apostolic poverty. As part of this, they rejected the use of luxurious decorations or the worship of imagery. They rejected doctrines that had no biblical support, including celibate priests and monks, the authority of the pope, the sacrament of confession, and even the transubstantiation of Christ's body and blood in the Eucharist. They demanded the election of priests rather than their appointment.\n\nIn effect, the petition was a confession of the Wycliffite faith in stark opposition to the traditional Catholic church. There could be no denying that it was a heresy now - and no denying that the Wycliffites had powerful supporters. To the $MONARCHTITLE$, it was a sobering realisation that $RULER_ADJ$ policies were not working - something had to be done about the Wycliffites."

 dg_hussite.008.d: "Without the support of the $MONARCHTITLE$, Wycliffite supporters faced persecution from the church. However, Wycliffite doctrines continued to be popular among the nobility, who eagerly took up the belief that the church and its lands should be subordinate to secular authorities. For this reason, some $PRIMARY_CULTURE$ nobles hid their Wycliffite faith.\n\nIt came as a shock to the entire court that the $MONARCHTITLE$'s closest advisor, one of the most powerful lords of the realm, was one of these secret Wycliffites. When the news broke, he was placed on trial, but managed to escape, fled $CAPITAL_CITY$, and raised an army of supporters with the hope of assassinating $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ and forcing Wycliffitism on $COUNTRY$.\n\nThis insurrection failed to garner support from fellow 'Wycliffite Knights' at court, who were not interested in committing treason. Some saw the rebellion as proof that Wycliffitism was a dangerous heresy that needed to be banned. In the end, all the insurrection achieved was in forcing the nobility to close ranks around their $MONARCHTITLE$."

 dg_hussite.009.t: "Wycliffitism Spreads to $COUNTRY$"
 dg_hussite.009.d: "Wycliffitism was a reform movement within the Catholic church. It used the $PRIMARY_CULTURE$ language to attack the church for its corruption and venality, and demanded the church return to a state of apostolic poverty by giving up their land, treasure and positions in government. It also demanded biblical support for all church doctrine, and in so doing, attacked the basis of exorcism, indulgences, confession - even the pope himself. For many, it was perilously close to heresy.\n\nWycliffitism spread to $COUNTRY$ via the university of $PROVINCECAPITAL$, whose connections to England brought ideas back that were hotly debated and exposed to the students, causing an uproar. Some people demanded that theologians supporting the movement be expelled from the university, where they could corrupt the sons of the nobility. Others worried that by so doing, they would be unleashing radical preachers upon the peasantry in their home villages."

 dg_hussite.010.t: "The Wycliffite Council"
 dg_hussite.010.d: "An ecumenical council has been called to deal with the issue of Wycliffitism, a reform movement that has grown out of control. In order to deal with the issue once and for all, it is necessary to have key Wycliffite theologians attend in order to present their defence and, if found guilty of heresy, publicly confess and recant. However, there is some fear that they would be treated as heretics. Our royal cousins have asked us to guarantee the safety of the theologians so that the council can proceed."

 dg_hussite.010.b: "We cannot make that promise"
 dg_hussite.016.t: "Secret Wycliffites"
 dg_hussite.016.d: "With $COUNTRY$'s recent conversion to the $COUNTRY_RELIGION$ faith, some $PRIMARY_CULTURE$ people are eagerly embracing the new religion. It seems that these men and women were secret Wycliffites who supported the heresy but were too afraid to openly profess their faith."

 dg_hussite.017.t: "The Wycliffite Chancellor"
 dg_hussite.017.d: "With the support of the $MONARCHTITLE$, Wycliffites rose quickly through the ranks in government and the army. This was upsetting to $COUNTRY_RELIGION$ nobles, who were increasingly relegated to less important roles at court.\n\nThe straw that broke the camel's back was when $MONARCH$ chose a Wycliffite to be $RULER_ADJ$ chief advisor and chancellor. Communicating with the pope, they received dispensation to disobey their $MONARCHTITLE$, and a collection of powerful nobles travelled to $CAPITAL_CITY$ and demanded the $MONARCHTITLE$ immediately fire all Wycliffites from public service."

 dg_hussite.053.d: "During the Lutheran Reformation, many Lutheran leaders saw the Hussites as an early form of Lutheranism - and, having failed to produce a Hussite state, many Hussites agreed. Nevertheless, there remained theological differences between the churches, and the Hussites resisted early attempts to convert them. As time went on, however, large numbers of Hussites drifted away from their church to one of the Lutheran denominations, seeing little difference between their faiths and wishing to become part of something greater."

 dg_papacy.001.d: "As the leader of the Catholic Church, the pope held great influence over millions of Catholics. Catholic rulers often envied or despised that influence and attempted to coerce popes into submission. By ruling over an independent state, the pope had an independent source of income and protection that gave him the appearance of neutrality. As a result, Catholic powers had an interest in making sure that Rome - the rightful seat of the Bishop of Rome - remained under the rule of the pope."

 dg_papacy.002.d: "With the Vatican under foreign rule the pope was forced to seek refuge in $CAPITAL_CITY$. Without access to his own source of income, he relies upon the generosity of $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ to fulfil his duties as Shepherd of the Faithful. These duties require him to spend a not inconsiderable sum of money - all of which we must provide.\n\nAn alternative to this would be to assign him a fief of his own. When pope Clement V moved his court to Avignon, it gave France virtual control over the papacy for decades - but it meant that Avignon passed out of French hands. How should we treat his holiness?"

 dg_papacy.007.b: "We need a new balance of power"
 dg_papacy.008.t: "The Independence of the Vatican"
 dg_papacy.008.d: "For centuries, the pope ruled over an independent state, giving him the wealth and power needed to remain neutral in European politics. As the bishop of Rome, he had a strong claim to the province - but the pope is now a prisoner in his own land, and the papal states no more. Now the nation that conquered Rome has offered a compromise: recognise the pope's rule over a small portion of the city, while securing his agreement that the rest of the province is theirs.

 dg_papacy.010.t: "Concordat with the Vatican"
 dg_papacy.010.d: "Although it was a rich and powerful city in its own right, Rome was also a holy city to pious Catholics. As the personal fief of the pope, it guaranteed neutrality...on paper, at least. Without a state of his own, however, the pope was a virtual prisoner in the Vatican and $COUNTRY$ was the villain of Christendom. A new pope has offered us a compromise, however: he will recognise us as the rightful rulers of Rome if we allow the Vatican to become an independent state within Rome ruled by the pope."

They were kept in line by the presence of the pope, a strong bureaucracy and the papal armies. Even then, the pope sometimes had to resort to guile or force to keep cities in line. When the capital was moved away from Rome, local despots took advantage of the pope's inattention to establish themselves as rulers of individual cities. Unable to actually enforce his rule over these provinces, many popes resorted to recognising the authority of these men, declaring them to be Vicars of the Church.

They were kept in line by the presence of the pope, a strong bureaucracy and the papal armies. Even then, the pope sometimes had to resort to guile or force to keep cities in line. When the capital was moved away from Rome, aristocratic families such as the Orsini, Colonna or Pepoli began to reassert their authority in attempts to seize control of trade or politics.

The traditional option was to appoint a Vicar to administer the new provinces for the pope, usually from the former royal family. In return, Vicars acknowledged the authority of the pope and send an annual tribute to $CAPITAL_CITY$.

 dg_papacy.032.t: "An Invitation"
 dg_papacy.032.d: "Concerned by the relative weakness of $COUNTRY$ and the threats to it, the ruler of [From.GetName] has invited the pope to take up residence within his kingdom, granting his holiness a fief in perpetuity to become the new papal seat. From there, we would be insulated from our rivals and assured their support and protection. On the other hand, we would be reliant upon our protector for support, and it would be an unpopular move among Italians, who saw Rome as the rightful seat of the pope."
 dg_papacy.032.a: "Move our capital to a safer place"
 dg_papacy.032.b: "Reject this attempt to control us"
 dg_papacy.033.t: "The Pope Declines Our Offer"
 dg_papacy.033.d: "A messenger from the pope has arrived. His holiness has graciously declined our invitation to establish the holy seat in $COUNTRY$, arguing that the proper place of a sitting pope is in Rome. We suspect that in reality he is concerned by how much influence we would have over him."
 dg_papacy.033.a: "How rude"
 dg_papacy.035.t: "Factions within the Curia"
 dg_papacy.035.d: "Even at the best of times, the Papal Curia was divided into factions with differing goals, patrons, languages and doctrines. Usually the friction between them was barely noticeable, but at times it became a major headache for the pope.\n\nWith the papal court in $CAPITAL_CITY$, a number of Italian cardinals have coalesced into a faction that is demanding the pope return to Rome. They argue that the Papacy is weakened by its absence from Italy - both because the rich lands of the peninsula are lost to its direct control, and because the independence of the Vatican itself is in doubt. On the other hand, other cardinals will firmly resist any effort to move the Curia away from $CAPITAL$. For a pope to do so, he would have to have enough control of the Curia to be able to replace dozens of cardinals and still command the respect of the Curia."
 dg_papacy.035.a: "Crush this rebellion"
 dg_papacy.035.b: "Return to Italy"
 dg_papacy.036.t: "Deposing a Pope"
 dg_papacy.036.d: "The new pope has rashly decided to break with tradition and move his court away from our protection. In so doing, he has summarily dismissed dozens of $PRIMARY_CULTURE$ cardinals from their posts and appointed new ones in their place. Even worse for us, he has refused to give back the lands we gave him!  These unprecedented acts have sent shock waves through the Curia!\n\nA number of deposed cardinals have gathered in a Synod and formally rejected the authority of the new pope, electing a $PRIMARY_CULTURE$ pope instead. He has sent messengers to $CAPITAL_CITY$, asking us for the same blessings and support we gave his predecessors.\n\nIf we support him, we may divide the church between these rival popes. If we do not, however, we may lose our influence with the papacy."
 dg_papacy.036.a: "Support the $PRIMARY_CULTURE$ pope"
 dg_papacy.036.b: "Back down from a schism"
 dg_papacy.037.d: "Furious at delays in electing the new pope and demanding the pope be chosen from their countrymen, a mob broke into the conclave and demanded the cardinals elect a new pope immediately. Rattled by this, the cardinals agreed to elect the pope on the next ballot. In so doing, they set aside careful calculations and put our plans in jeopardy."
 dg_papacy.037.a: "Let us hope the new pope is reasonable"
 dg_papacy.041.t: "Jubilee $YEAR$"
 dg_papacy.041.d: "In Jewish tradition, every 50 years God's mercy is celebrated by pardoning sins, freeing prisoners and forgiving debts. Pope Boniface VIII introduced the practise to Christianity in 1300 and his successors continued the practise, calling a Jubilee every 25 years thereafter. Jubilee years were marked by a noticeable moral tone, but their most lasting contribution was probably turning Rome into a major centre of pilgrimage and enriching the papacy as a result."
 dg_papacy.041.a: "Call a Jubilee"
 dg_papacy.042.t: "Papal Relations"
 dg_papacy.042.d: "Although popes were forbidden from marrying, they still had relatives. Many popes came from powerful families who often lived nearby and expected their family ties would result in special favours. Many nephews of popes were made into Cardinals, and illegitimate children often received church land as fiefs. This kind of nepotism was commonplace practise by royalty but scandalous when practised by popes who were not supposed to treat the papacy as their private property."

 dg_papacy.044.t: "Patronage of the Church"
 dg_papacy.044.d: "Well into the sixteenth century the church paid for four out of five commissions. Lacking many opportunities in secular life, thousands of artisans and scribes flocked to $CAPITAL_CITY$ to find employment. The most sought-after jobs were largely ceremonial and required little to no work. Several popes tried to eliminate these positions, resulting in riots. Other popes were made famous for the beautiful works commissioned by them."

 dg_papacy.045.t: "The Glory of $CAPITAL_CITY$"
 dg_papacy.045.d: "As the headquarters of the Catholic Church, the Vatican was filled with churches, cathedrals and Roman ruins that drew pilgrims from across Christendom. There was an expectation that such a holy site would appear like heaven, and the papacy tried hard to reach that aim. Successive popes left their mark on $CAPITAL_CITY$ by building palaces, fountains, cathedrals, and of course the great Basilica di San Pietro, built over more than a century under a dozen popes."

 dg_papacy.046.t: "Papal Finances"
 dg_papacy.046.d: "Although the pope claimed to be superior to secular rulers, in reality it was difficult and costly to keep up with the great courts of Europe. At times the papacy was driven into bankruptcy!  Several popes who began their reign with dreams of introducing reforms or rooting out heresy found themselves mired in tax codes and financial records. In an attempt to rebuild state finances, some popes came up with creative ideas.\n\nOne idea was to require priests to charge their parishioners for services that had previously been free. Although lucrative, this caused people to grumble at the greed of the church. Another option was to encourage voluntary donations by granting absolution to pilgrims who gave alms. From there it was a short step to licensing regions to indulgence peddlers who gave the pope a portion of their profits as they over-enthusiastically sold indulgences to peasants. Another idea was to hold a state lottery in which ordinary subjects could buy a chance to win riches. This idea had been tried in other countries with great success, but gambling was seen as a sin by many Christians. Finally, there was always the option of raising taxes and cutting down on needless expenses - although that was a last resort."

 dg_papacy.049.t: "The Sack of Rome"
 dg_papacy.049.d: "Although it was not unheard of for a Christian lord to invade the Papal States and even to seize Rome, the city itself was usually treated gently. As the ancient capital of the Roman Empire and the seat of the Catholic Church, it held a special place in the heart of all Catholics. Thus, when unpaid mercenary troops mutinied and looted the city in $YEAR$, it came as a shock to the Christian world. In an orgy of destruction lasting for weeks, churches were looted, priests were slain, nuns raped, and the pope himself tortured. It would take decades to rebuild the city - ironically helping to usher in the Baroque movement."

 dg_papacy.052.t: "Questioning the Donation of Constantine"
 dg_papacy.052.d: "In his scholarly studies, $THEOLOGIAN$ has made a shocking discovery: the Donation of Constantine is, in fact, a forgery!\n\nThe Donation of Constantine was a document signed by Roman Emperor Constantine in the fourth century, signing over supreme authority over the Western Roman Empire to Pope Sylvester I in thanks for a miraculous cure. The Donation was used as proof of the pope's claims to Rome and its environs, as well as his claims to authority over secular rulers in the West.\n\nThe Donation failed to hold up to the scrutiny it received during the Renaissance. Not only were some supporting details wrong, but the phraseology and vocabulary of the document were radically wrong for the fourth century. To a theologian and historian as brilliant as $THEOLOGIAN$, it soon became apparent that it was in fact invented sometime in the eigth century - hundreds of years after the fall of the Western Roman Emperor. This news will surely embarrass and anger the pope."
 dg_papacy.052.a: "Publicly raise questions"

 dg_papacy.053.t: "Pope's Legitimacy Questioned"
 dg_papacy.053.d: "With the rise of humanism, theologians and scholars began to examine church history in more detail. One document in particular was exposed to great scrutiny: the Donation of Constantine. It was signed by Roman Emperor Constantine, signing over supreme authority over the Western Roman Empire to Pope Sylvester I in thanks for a miraculous cure. The papacy used it as proof of both the pope's right to rule over Italy, and as the pope's rightful authority over the kings and princes of Europe.\n\nA prominent theologian is raising serious questions about the Donation's authenticity, claiming that it is in fact an eigth century forgery. If allowed to circulate, this rumour will surely damage the reputation of the Holy See."

 dg_papacy.056.t: "Conspiracy against the Pope"
 dg_papacy.056.d: "The pope has discovered a conspiracy to assassinate him among the cardinals and now has ordered the arrest and execution of several of those involved. It appears that they had had enough of his corrupt ways and were attempting to remove him from the throne of Saint Peter. Others whisper that the pope has large debts to pay, and seizing the assets of the executed cardinals might be a way to pay them off."

 dg_papacy.065.d: "The pope has called for a crusade against the infidel. However, in these sinful days, we cannot count on the support of Christendom for such a holy war. It would go a long way toward victory if a strong Christian prince took up the cross and waged war against the enemy personally. We could cast around for a likely candidate, or we could lead by example and prepare to declare war!"

 dg_papacy.066.d: "His holiness has called for a Catholic crusade against the infidel, and has personally asked $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ to lead it. This is quite the honour!  Yet it is not something we should undertake rashly. Crusaders come from many countries and are disorganised at best, incompetent at worst. Even in the golden age of crusades, many crusades ended in disaster rather than victory. Today, we cannot count on the support of Christendom.

 dg_papacy.069.d: "Despite the blessing of the Pope, the state monopoly established by the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is running into problems. A black market has sprung up in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName], run by smugglers able to undercut monopoly prices and eagerly bought up by burghers who see the higher prices on necessities as a tax.

 dg_papacy.069.b: "Sell off the rights"
 dg_papacy.081.t: "Internationalization of the College"
 dg_papacy.081.d: "After years of work, the commission of cardinals has finally agreed on a series of reforms which they are recommending to Pope $MONARCH$.\n\nSince most cardinals were appointed from clergy who had worked with the pope, it was rare to have cardinals from distant lands. This created a sense of isolation from the papacy for some countries. The commission is recommending that the papacy internationalize the Curia, establishing a set of rules that will encourage the appointment of cardinals from many nations rather than just those near the Vatican.\n\nLike all papal reforms, it may take more than one commission to enable a reform. The more the church demands reforms, the more effective each option will become."
 dg_papacy.081.a: "Implement the recommendations of the commission"
 dg_papacy.081.b: "Introduce minor reforms"
 dg_papacy.081.c: "Disavow the commission entirely"
 dg_papacy.082.t: "The College of Cardinals"
 dg_papacy.082.d: "After years of work, the commission of cardinals has finally agreed on a series of reforms which they are recommending to Pope $MONARCH$.\n\nOne of the pope's strongest powers was his right to appoint new cardinals, who in turn chose his successor. New popes had a habit of appointing friends and countrymen to the post, helping to 'stack the deck' in their favour. This caused some friction with the existing cardinals and sometimes led to one nation having more influence over the curia than it ought. The commission is recommending imposing strict limits on the number of cardinals allowed in the curia at one time. This would reduce the ability of the pope to appoint new cardinals and so result in more qualified men taking up the position.\n\nLike all papal reforms, it may take more than one commission to enable a reform. The more the church demands reforms, the more effective each option will become."
 dg_papacy.083.t: "Conclave Rules"
 dg_papacy.083.d: "After years of work, the commission of cardinals has finally agreed on a series of reforms which they are recommending to Pope $MONARCH$.\n\nPapal conclaves were usually swift, but could sometimes drag on for years. Because a two-thirds majority was required for the pope to be chosen, a conclave could go on intermittently if two sides refused to compromise, or if outside pressure was being applied. Sometimes a conclave only ended with the death of one papabile!  At other times, a lengthy conclave was explained by the reluctance of the cardinals to cede power. The commission recommends introducing strict new rules to push cardinals to make swift decisions during conclaves. Not only would voting rules be relaxed, but the longer a conclave went on for, the more uncomfortable things would get for the cardinals, as food and water would be gradually reduced and, in extremis, the roof of the building would be removed and the rain let in until a pope was chosen.\n\nLike all papal reforms, it may take more than one commission to enable a reform. The more the church demands reforms, the more effective each option will become."
 dg_papacy.084.t: "Index of Prohibited Books"
 dg_papacy.084.d: "After years of work, the commission of cardinals has finally agreed on a series of reforms which they are recommending to Pope $MONARCH$.\n\nHeresy often spread via pamphlet and tract in the hands of radicals, especially after the invention of the printing press. The commission recommends the establishment of a list of books that good Catholic rulers ought to ban from their nations. This would force radicals to go underground and harm their missionary efforts among unsuspecting Catholics.\n\nLike all papal reforms, it may take more than one commission to enable a reform. The more the church demands reforms, the more effective each option will become."
 dg_papacy.085.t: "Ad Limina Visits"
 dg_papacy.085.d: "After years of work, the commission of cardinals has finally agreed on a series of reforms which they are recommending to Pope $MONARCH$.\n\nOne of the greatest challenges the Church faced was having to maintain orthodoxy across multiple nations and millions of parishioners. To this end, individual bishops were empowered to root out heresy in their dioceses. However, not all bishops were equally effective, and as recent years had shown, it was always better to wipe out heresy as soon as it appeared. The commission recommends imposing 'ad limina' visits on all Catholic bishops - the requirement that they travel to the Vatican every few years in order to report on their dioceses personally. The requirement would be relaxed for bishops who would have a hard time visiting the Vatican, but even then, they would have to make the visit once a decade. Although it was meant to combat absenteeism and heresy, the main effect of this reform would be to increase the authority of the pope.\n\nLike all papal reforms, it may take more than one commission to enable a reform. The more the church demands reforms, the more effective each option will become."
 dg_papacy.086.t: "The New Vulgate Bible"
 dg_papacy.086.d: "After years of work, the commission of cardinals has finally agreed on a series of reforms which they are recommending to Pope $MONARCH$.\n\nThe official Bible of the Catholic Church was the Latin Vulgate bible. As the West gained access to earlier Greek Bibles, they discovered errors in the translation used in the official text, which led to many Catholics losing faith in their Church. The commission recommends that a team of scholars, theologians and linguists scour these new sources and write a new version of the Vulgate Bible.\n\nLike all papal reforms, it may take more than one commission to enable a reform. The more the church demands reforms, the more effective each option will become."
 dg_papacy.087.t: "A Roman Inquisition"
 dg_papacy.087.d: "After years of work, the commission of cardinals has finally agreed on a series of reforms which they are recommending to Pope $MONARCH$.\n\nHistory has shown that heresy can reach even to the heart of the Church!  The commission recommends establishing a kind of Inquisition to root out heretics from the Papal States, handing them over to secular authorities for punishment. This would become the model used by secular nations to fight against heresy.\n\nLike all papal reforms, it may take more than one commission to enable a reform. The more the church demands reforms, the more effective each option will become."
 dg_papacy.088.t: "Rules against nepotism"
 dg_papacy.088.d: "After years of work, the commission of cardinals has finally agreed on a series of reforms which they are recommending to Pope $MONARCH$.\n\nLike any other ruler, many popes saw their office as a chance to enrich their families. The problem was that the pope was not just any other ruler - he was the holy leader of the Catholic Church, and such nepotism was giving the Church a bad name. It was even worse when the pope gave special favours to a bastard son born from a mistress. Some priests and even cardinals were known to keep mistresses, but the pope was supposed to be above all that. Having such a visible sign of his sins around, long after his death, was embarrassing for church leaders. The commission recommends imposing a series of laws that would make it difficult for popes to assign benefices, positions and gifts to family members, and require them to send away bastards and mistresses.\n\nLike all papal reforms, it may take more than one commission to enable a reform. The more the church demands reforms, the more effective each option will become."
 dg_pope.001.t: "Death of the Pope"
 dg_pope.001.d: "Most popes were already old when elected, and their reigns lasted just a few years on average. Some of them passed away before they were actually consecrated as pope!  After the pope was declared dead, grief spread throughout Christendom. Cardinals who could travel to [the_vatican.GetCapitalName] made the pilgrimage to elect a new pope, a process that could take months."
 dg_pope.001.a: "The Church calls a conclave"
 dg_pope.002.t: "Papabile Vetoed"
 dg_pope.002.d: "To avoid the risk of rival popes being elected again, powerful secular rulers were given the right to intervene in papal conclaves if they saw a risk of schism. The pope reached out to powerful Catholic rulers of the 'five kingdoms' of Italy, France, Spain, Germany and England, giving certain rulers the right to veto one candidate each during papal conclaves. They sent cardinals from their lands to [the_vatican.GetCapitalName] with instructions to use this right of exclusion if an unacceptable candidate was about to be elected. Although this practise helped prevent anti-popes, it also turned conclaves into political arenas where powerful princes influenced cardinals to elect popes sympathetic to their cause."
 dg_pope.002.a: "Throw our support behind another candidate"
 dg_pope.003.t: "Deadlocked Conclave"
 dg_pope.003.d: "When a conclave was called to elect a new pope, cardinals from across Italy went to the Holy See to join the College of Cardinals. Secluded from the outside world, they remained there until a new pope was chosen by acclamation (unanimous approval) or, if that failed, by receiving two-thirds of the vote. These stringent measures were meant to avoid an anti-pope claiming victory, but they could also result in deadlocked conclaves. Factions supporting different candidates sometimes refused to compromise or back down, vote after vote, sometimes for months on end. To force a choice, Conclaves would be offered only bread and water and, in one memorable instance, actually had the roof of the building removed so the cardinals would be rained on until they came to an agreement."
 dg_pope.003.a: "Pray for guidance"
 dg_pope.003.b: "Make life uncomfortable until they choose"
 dg_pope.004.t: "Habemus Papam!"
 dg_pope.004.d: "Although nearly every pope was Italian, the fact that Italy was divided meant that many empires had influence there. Papal conclaves could become deeply political with the great powers always interested in the results. At times one nation was able to influence enough votes in the college of cardinals to ensure that a particular candidate was elected. This sometimes resulted in candidates that were elected simply because they would serve the interests of a kingdom or empire, not because they were holy men.\n\nOur influence has allowed us to guide this decision to select the new pope. Why did we choose him?"
 dg_pope.004.a: "The new pope is acceptable to us"
 dg_pope.004.b: "The new pope can be manipulated by us"
 dg_pope.005.d: "When the College of Cardinals met, they were instructed to pray for guidance and choose the best man for the church. Despite scandals and corruption, many cardinals were pious men who followed this advice and tried to vote their conscience. The only question was what type of man the church needed!  This question divided the college, but by tradition, when a cardinal realised that one papabile was going to win, they would switch their vote to him in order to present a new pope by universal acclaim and avoid a messy election.\n\nWith our help, a new pope has been chosen. Why did we support him?"
 dg_pope.005.a: "The new pope is a capable man"
 dg_pope.005.b: "The new pope is a saintly man"

 dg_pope.006.a: "May God grant him long life"
 dg_pope.006.b: "Let us pray he can reform the Church"
 dg_pope.007.d: "Our archbishop brings news from the Holy See: A new pope has been chosen!  We know little of him or how he plans to lead the church, but he obviously has strong support."
 dg_pope.007.a: "May he be the leader the church needs"

 dg_pope.008.a: "Let us hope rumours are untrue"
 dg_pope.009.t: "Summer Heat Prolongs Conclave"
 dg_pope.009.d: "According to rules brought in to encourage shorter conclaves, the cardinals were locked in the Vatican and given only the barest of food and water until they came to a decision - sometimes with the corpse of the former pope lying in state next to them. This was not pleasant even under the best of circumstances, but during the blazing Italian summer, it could be deadly to frail old men wearing heavy robes. Cardinals were known to suffer heat stroke during summer conclaves and deaths were not unheard of. When things got particularly rough, the cardinals would occasionally vote to adjourn for the summer and return in the autumn. This was a breach of the rules, but understandable."
 dg_pope.009.a: "We can wait a few more months for a pope"
 dg_pope.009.b: "Force the cardinals back to work"
 dg_pope.011.t: "A Case Comes before the Papal Court"
 dg_pope.011.d: "When peasants needed forgiveness of a sin, they went to their parish priest. When rulers needed forgiveness, they needed to seek someone with greater authority than themselves. Rulers who needed permission to annul a failed marriage, forgiveness for using torture, or other sins against God, could turn to the one man in Christendom with the authority to forgive them: the pope. Dispensation was often granted to rulers who showed repentance, but sometimes pressure was put on the pope..."

 dg_pope.011.h: "Refuse dispensation"
 dg_pope.012.t: "A Case Comes before the Papal Court"
 dg_pope.012.d: "For both moral and physical reasons, the church forbade marriage to those within seven degrees of separation from each other - as distant as third cousins. This encouraged villagers to travel and marry in other areas and helped avoid many hereditary defects, but it was also quite complex to keep track of genealogy, so the rule resulted in many broken engagements and annulled marriages. The church responded by offering dispensation to couples who were only marginally related to each other. When the petitioners came from the royal families of Christendom, the pope got involved personally. Dispensation was usually granted, but an unscrupulous or ambitious pope could deny it to punish the countries involved for some slight."
 dg_pope.012.a: "Grant permission for the wedding"
 dg_pope.012.b: "Forbid this impure union"
 dg_pope.013.t: "The Infidel Threat"
 dg_pope.013.d: "The crusades were the Catholic response to the Muslim occupation of the Holy Land in the eleventh century. Although the crusades had limited success, they brought relative peace to Europe and glory to the pope. The last great crusade ended in the thirteenth century, but later popes revived the concept with a series of small-scale crusades against heretics and infidels. Once again, the borders of Christendom face an infidel threat, and a prince has begged us for aid against the heathens. How shall we respond?"
 dg_pope.013.a: "Call a crusade"
 dg_pope.013.b: "Other matters demand our attention"
 dg_pope.015.t: "The Heretic Threat"
 dg_pope.015.d: "From its very beginnings as a religion, differing understandings of doctrine and scripture split the Christian church - sometimes permanently - weakening it against infidels. As a result, the Catholic Church took a hard line against suspected heretics, demanding obedience and repentance in order to not divide the church yet again. When that failed, church councils could sometimes heal a schism. But when Catholic princes took up the cause of heresy as their own, only one solution remained: to convert heretics back to the true faith by the sword. A crusade!"
 dg_pope.015.a: "Call a crusade"
 dg_pope.015.b: "Seek a diplomatic solution"
 dg_pope.016.t: "Appointing New Cardinals"
 dg_pope.016.d: "The pope alone has the power to appoint new cardinals, and by tradition most popes did so early in their papacies, to replace cardinals who had died, to acknowledge particularly devout theologians, or to reward supporters and family members. Popes would call a consistory and announce the names of the new cardinals, who would receive the cap and ring of their new rank in a public ceremony. Although canon law set the number of cardinals to 20, this limit was ignored by popes who saw the need to appoint like-minded bishops, and was later raised to 70. The new cardinals swelling the ranks of the college meant that each cardinal was relatively less important - at least until their number dwindled once more.\n\nAlthough he tried to be neutral, the pope has appointed several cardinals from among the bishops he knew in his home country before his accession to the throne of St. Peter. This meant that his former patron was likely to gain influence in the curia, and hence, more opportunities to influence the next conclave."
 dg_pope.016.a: "Encourage him to appoint only worthy men"
 dg_pope.016.b: "Suggest a few names to him"
 dg_pope.016.c: "Demand that he increase the number of $PRIMARY_CULTURE$ cardinals"

The new cardinals swelling the ranks of the college meant that each cardinal was relatively less important - at least until their number dwindled once more.\n\nMany popes took advantage of this power to enrich their family, appointing nephews and other close relatives as cardinals in addition to the usual number of cardinals raised from former colleagues and countrymen. Although frowned upon, this practise was largely ignored."
 dg_pope.018.d: "The pope alone has the power to appoint new cardinals, and by tradition most popes did so early in their papacies, to replace cardinals who had died, to acknowledge particularly devout theologians, or to reward supporters and family members.

However, the current pope has gone further, appointing one of his sons and the brother of his mistress as cardinals!  Used to hearing about sons of bishops, the church is nevertheless stunned by this blatant acknowledgement of the pope's lack of celibacy, and it has caused a scandal in the Vatican."
 dg_pope.020.t: "A Cardinal Sin"
 dg_pope.020.d: "The pope alone had the power to appoint new cardinals, and it was expected that new popes would use this power to appoint colleagues, countrymen and nephews to the post, in the same way that a secular prince would be expected to find government posts for his friends and relatives. However, it shocked the Vatican when pope $MONARCH$ appointed his bastard son to the cardinal's robes. While it was acknowledged that priests and bishops sometimes kept mistresses, having such an overt acknowledgement of the pope's infidelity was still beyond what polite society could accept."
 dg_pope.020.a: "Who can condemn the pope?"
 dg_pope.021.d: "The [From.Monarch.GetTitle] of [From.GetName] has formally requested that the pope declare [From.Monarch.GetHerHis] marriage null and void.\n\nSince the Catholic Church does not permit divorce, someone wishing to dissolve [From.Monarch.GetHerHis] marriage had to seek an annulment instead - prove that the marriage had been invalid in the first place due to fraud, error, or the inability to produce children. Although it was difficult to prove these, it could be done - and when it was a ruler who sought an annulment, it was up to the pope to hear the evidence."
 dg_pope.021.a: "Pressure him into granting the annulment"
 dg_pope.021.b: "Encourage him to grant the annulment"
 dg_pope.021.c: "Stay removed from this situation"
 dg_pope.021.domestic: "\nUsually cases like this were summarily granted, since monarchs had compelling reasons to control the succession of their countries. Only if the situation was unusual or the pope poorly disposed to the country would it be denied."
 dg_pope.021.e: "Encourage him to declare the marriage valid"
 dg_pope.021.f: "Pressure him into declaring the marriage valid"
 dg_pope.021.international: "\nThis particular case is vexing, for both individuals belong to ruling houses. To deny the annulment would anger the [From.GetAdjective] [From.Monarch.GetTitle], while to allow it would anger [From.Monarch.GetHerHis] spouse."
 dg_pope.022.t: "The Victory of Conciliarism"
 dg_pope.022.d: "In the early thirteenth century some canon lawyers speculated what to do if a pope became a heretic, and concluded that ultimate power rested in the hands of the church itself, as embodied in an ecumenical council. Meant as an exercise in theory, it gained serious attention during the schism as rival popes split the church. As they watched successive popes fail to heal the schism, many lay Catholics, bishops and rulers began to believe that only a council could truly reform the church. This culminated in a church council which declared that the pope was required to call a church council every decade - in effect handing over power to the bishops."
 dg_pope.023.t: "The Defeat of Conciliarism"
 dg_pope.023.d: "Following the intense diplomatic efforts of the popes, the majority of bishops at the council have agreed to publish the bull 'Pastor aeturnus', a scathing indictment of Conciliarism. Declaring the doctrine to be heresy, the bull formally acknowledged the supremacy of the pope over church councils when deciding doctrine, and freed the pope from promises to call regular councils."
 dg_pope.023.a: "Get rid of councils altogether"
 dg_pope.023.b: "Be gracious in victory"
 dg_pope.024.t: "Church Settlement"
 dg_pope.024.d: "Eager to regain control over the church, early modern popes were willing to make compromises with secular rulers, giving them considerable control over the Catholic church within their lands on the condition that they abandon their support for conciliarism.\n\nDifferent concordats were signed in different places, depending on the desires of rulers and their bargaining power with the Vatican. Some nations restricted ecclesiastical jurisdiction and clerical immunity; in some nations, an emergency tithe on church property became a regular tax; in many nations, the ruler secured the right to appoint bishops and reform monasteries. Finally, in the 'five kingdoms' of Spain, France, Germany, Italy and England, rulers were offered an extra incentive - a veto over papal candidates in elections. The effect was to rally support for the pope and the Catholic church among the elite of Europe, although it was not always seen positively by the laity."
 dg_pope.024.a: "Abandon our support for conciliarism"
 dg_pope.024.b: "Refuse to compromise"
 dg_pope.025.t: "The $PRIMARY_CULTURE$ Cardinal"
 dg_pope.025.d: "Ignoring the will of the $MONARCHTITLE$, the pope has decided to appoint a $PRIMARY_CULTURE$ cardinal from our lands. Given our recent conversion away from the Catholic church, this can only be seen as a slap in the face."
 dg_pope.025.a: "Execute him for this affront"
 dg_pope.025.b: "Allow him to go to the Vatican"
 dg_pope.026.t: "Papal Consistory Meets"
 dg_pope.026.d: "A consistory was a meeting of the cardinals of the Catholic Church. Held about twice a year, it was an opportunity for popes to decide matters of faith, dispense justice, and seek the support or advice of the cardinals. By tradition, it was also when popes would elevate men to the rank of cardinal.\n\nSome popes made dozens of cardinals, while others elevated none at all. Some popes accepted bribes while others considered only the most pious men for the job. At times this caused friction between the papacy and the nations of Europe. With the cardinals able to select the next pope, there was considerable pressure to maintain the balance of power between different nations and nationalities."
 dg_pope.026.a: "Appoint only the most select men"
 dg_pope.026.b: "Appoint all worthy candidates"
 dg_pope.026.c: "Appoint every candidate"
 dg_pope.027.t: "Grounds for Excommunication"
 dg_pope.027.d: "It seems that one of our fellow Catholic rulers has crossed the line, and now the pope is considering excommunicating them!  This is the strongest step that the pope can take, and is not a decision to be taken lightly.\n"

 dg_pope.028.t: "Papal Nuncio Returns from $FROMCOUNTRY$"

 dg_pope.028.a: "I see"
 dg_pope.031.t: "Demands for an Ecumenical Council"
 dg_pope.031.d: "The Catholic church was ordained by God but made up of mortal men, expected to be perfect but sometimes falling short of heaven. Pious Catholics understood this, but occasionally the church could go too far. A particularly odious scandal or blatant corruption could lead to calls for reform in the church. When even kings and princes began demanding the pope call a council, it was time to re-evaluate where things stood."
 dg_pope.031.a: "Call a general council"
 dg_pope.031.b: "Promise to hold a council when the time is right"
 dg_pope.031.c: "The church needs a firm hand to guide it"
 dg_pope.032.t: "Church Matters"
 dg_pope.032.d: "Delegates brought with them criticism and ideas, but although church councils could overrule a sitting pope and set church doctrine, the pope was still the leader of the church. As a result, the pope controlled discussion of the councils by introducing topics to it - although this was by no means a promise that that issue would be resolved, only that it would be discussed. What topic should his holiness emphasise?"
 dg_pope.032.a: "Discuss fine points of theology"
 dg_pope.033.t: "Church Reform of Simony"
 dg_pope.033.d: "After Clement V reorganised the church, the pope gained the right to appoint bishops to their benefices. When a bishop died, the benefice returned to the pope. An unforeseen effect of this was to encourage simony, or payment in return for church titles. This practise excluded peasants from the highest ranks of the church and placed a burden of debt on bishops that caused many to tax their tenants harshly. As the practise grew widespread it caused a backlash against the church.\n\nIt may require several reforms to eradicate this entrenched practise. The higher church reform desire is, the more effective reforms will be. However, it requires papal influence to push the harshest reforms forward."
 dg_pope.033.a: "Impose stringent rules to stop the practise"
 dg_pope.033.b: "Introduce minor changes"
 dg_pope.034.t: "Church Reform of Indulgences"
 dg_pope.034.d: "Catholics who sinned needed to go through a process to find forgiveness: first they had to repent the sin, then they had to confess it to a priest, and finally they had to do penance - good works such as pilgrimages or fasting in order to make up for the evil they had done. An indulgence was a way to bypass doing penance by getting the church to bless you with some of the grace of dead saints. Unscrupulous indulgence peddlers went much further, promising that indulgences meant you didn't have to go to confession, that they could allow the dead to escape purgatory, even that they could be used to forgive sins that people had not yet committed!  Pious theologians were horrified at these claims but credulous peasants bought them up rapidly. Soon a steady flow of gold passed into the hands of such peddlers, to be split between them, the archbishops who had authorised it, and the pope himself.\n\nIt may require several reforms to eradicate this entrenched practise. The higher church reform desire is, the more effective reforms will be. However, it requires papal influence to push the harshest reforms forward."
 dg_pope.034.a: "Forbid the sale of indulgences"
 dg_pope.034.b: "Condemn the excesses of indulgence peddlers"
 dg_pope.035.t: "Church Reform of Benefices"
 dg_pope.035.d: "Beginning in the fourteenth century the pope collected the first year's income (annate) from the benefice granted to a new bishop. This was a common custom by feudal rulers upon granting a fief to a vassal, so by claiming this right, the pope was taking money away from secular rulers. In addition, regardless of who the money went to, this practise forced new bishops to borrow heavily or overtax their peasants in order to pay this sum, something which made the church seem oppressive to the locals.\n\nIt may require several reforms to eradicate this entrenched practise. The higher church reform desire is, the more effective reforms will be. However, it requires papal influence to push the harshest reforms forward."
 dg_pope.035.a: "End the practise of paying the annate"
 dg_pope.035.b: "Lower payments to a more manageable sum"
 dg_pope.036.t: "Church Reform of Untrained Priests"
 dg_pope.036.d: "Although large cities often had cathedral schools where future priests received a classical education alongside noble scions, more rural parishes often had little access to schooling and little money to send a priest away for several years. Instead, local nobles appointed priests, and these priests trained their successors personally. This was simple, but led to uneducated priests who sometimes couldn't even read Latin!  It was no wonder that these rural parishes could become centres of heresy. In theory the fault lay in local bishops whose task was to oversee the priests in their diocese, but in practise they were often suffering from the same problems.\n\nIt may require several reforms to eradicate this entrenched practise. The higher church reform desire is, the more effective reforms will be. However, it requires papal influence to push the harshest reforms forward."
 dg_pope.036.a: "Require each diocese to build a seminary"
 dg_pope.036.b: "Demand that bishops supervise their diocese"
 dg_pope.037.t: "Church Reform of Pluralism"
 dg_pope.037.d: "After Clement V reorganised the church, the pope gained the right to appoint bishops to their benefices in return for payment. As this practise became more widespread, some nobles saw it as an investment. They spent vast sums of money to secure two or more benefices for themselves or a son. By holding two offices at the same time, such bishops gained a large income, but this practise of pluralism also meant vacant diocese with no trained bishop living there, which only added to the problems the church was suffering. Some bishops went so far as to openly live far away from any of their benefices, preferring big city life instead.\n\nIt may require several reforms to eradicate this entrenched practise. The higher church reform desire is, the more effective reforms will be. However, it requires papal influence to push the harshest reforms forward."
 dg_pope.037.a: "Require clerics to reside in their parishes"
 dg_pope.037.b: "Emphasise the importance of parishes"
 dg_pope.038.t: "Church Reform of Nepotism"
 dg_pope.038.d: "It was an accepted practise for kings and princes to give fiefs to their sons. As the prestige of the papacy grew, popes grew in status to be equals of these princes, owning vast estates and commanding armies. Many acted as a prince would, granting fiefs to their relatives or illegitimate children or making nephews cardinals with valuable benefices. This entirely secular behaviour did not enhance the prestige of the papacy.\n\nIt may require several reforms to eradicate this entrenched practise. The higher church reform desire is, the more effective reforms will be. However, it requires papal influence to push the harshest reforms forward."
 dg_pope.038.a: "Impose stringent rules to stop the practise"
 dg_pope.038.b: "Condemn the practise"
 dg_pope.041.t: "Electing a New Pope"
 dg_pope.041.d: "Everyone agreed that the schism that had split the Catholic church needed to be dealt with, but increasingly it appeared that the rival popes were unwilling or unable to do it themselves. As a result, frustrated Catholics looked to ecumenical councils to provide the solution. At a Church council, enough cardinals could be brought together to depose the anti-popes and elect a new one that everyone would agree on. But there was a catch to this solution: it meant that not only would this new pope, but all future popes would be subservient to councils. Reformers went even further, demanding that the pope agree to call councils on a regular basis in order to prevent this kind of schism from ever happening again."
 dg_pope.041.a: "Promise to hold regular councils in return for the Holy See"
 dg_pope.041.b: "Maintain the supremacy of the pope"
 dg_pope.042.t: "The Wycliffite Question"
 dg_pope.042.d: "Over the past two generations a heresy has arisen in Christendom. The so-called 'Wycliffites' began as a movement to reform the church, believing that the corruption in the church could be eradicated by having the church give up its secular power and wealth. That in itself was bad enough, but the Wycliffites went even further by demanding that all worshippers have the right to partake in both body and blood of Christ during communion. This went against Catholic doctrine, which taught that Christ was entirely present in each, and so there was no need to have both. This 'Calixtine' doctrine, then, was a clear heresy - and needed to be purged from the church, as it had done so many times before, lest it damage the unity of the church.\n\nAt the council, church leaders heard from Wycliffite theologians, refuting their claims and showing them the truth - yet they failed to repent or recant. Reluctantly, the council ordered the execution of the heretics."
 dg_pope.042.a: "Declare Wycliffitism to be heresy"
 dg_pope.051.t: "The Fate of the Catholic Church"
 dg_pope.051.d: "In a time when it could take letters months to reach parts of Europe, clarity was essential to avoid misunderstandings on crucial issues. For this reason the church used Latin as its only language, and this prompted scholars across Europe to use it as well as a common tongue of learning. As centuries passed, however, this adherence to a dead language made the Bible and the Mass inaccessible to the common man. Lutherans, who emphasised a personal relationship with God and who had no central authority to demand a common theology, allowed the use of the vernacular instead. It was clear from the spread of the Reformation just how powerful a method this was, and many voices in the church demanded it change in order to keep up with them. Others demanded the church ban it entirely in order to keep itself pure.\n\nDoctrinal decisions such as this were hotly debated in the church. Before a decision could be adopted, it had to be accepted by church leaders. This often demanded multiple councils agreeing on a doctrine. However, the higher church reform is, the more quickly the church will realise it has to take a stand."
 dg_pope.051.a: "Enforce unity through Latin"
 dg_pope.051.b: "Allow the local tongue to be used"
 dg_pope.052.t: "The Fate of the Catholic Church"
 dg_pope.052.d: "Many of the theological debates of the Reformation went over the heads of the common worshipper. One that did not was the communion. Catholic tradition argued that the body and blood of Christ was found in both the bread and wine of sacrament, which meant ordinary Catholics had no need to partake of both. As a result, the cup of His blood was reserved for priests. This seemed unfair to the average peasant, and had been one of the key issues of the Hussite wars of the fifteenth century.\n\nLutherans took up this belief, claiming that since every believer had a personal relationship with God, they were all priests and could therefore drink from the cup. Some Catholic reformers felt like allowing all worshippers to drink from the cup would convince Lutherans to return to the church, while others saw it as a dangerous precedent to bend doctrine.\n\nDoctrinal decisions such as this were hotly debated in the church. Before a decision could be adopted, it had to be accepted by church leaders. This often demanded multiple councils agreeing on a doctrine. However, the higher church reform is, the more quickly the church will realise it has to take a stand."
 dg_pope.052.a: "There is no need for both kinds"
 dg_pope.052.b: "The appearance of fairness is more important than doctrine"
 dg_pope.053.t: "The Fate of the Catholic Church"
 dg_pope.053.d: "The printing press, growing literacy and the translation of the Bible into the vernacular led to many people reading the Bible for the first time. Many were shocked to find no clear evidence for some Catholic traditions such as clerical celibacy, confession, transubstantiation or papal infallibility. Lutherans used this to claim that the church had strayed from what Christ wanted and vowed to make doctrine based purely on the Bible, while Catholics accused Lutherans of being inflexible and outdated, arguing that centuries of tradition were worth as much as scripture. However, some Catholics wanted to take the opportunity to return the church to its fundamentals.\n\nDoctrinal decisions such as this were hotly debated in the church. Before a decision could be adopted, it had to be accepted by church leaders. This often demanded multiple councils agreeing on a doctrine. However, the higher church reform is, the more quickly the church will realise it has to take a stand."
 dg_pope.053.a: "Tradition is just as important as scripture"
 dg_pope.053.b: "Our faith must be based on scripture alone"
 dg_pope.054.t: "The Fate of the Catholic Church"
 dg_pope.054.d: "One of the sharpest differences between Catholics and Lutherans was the latter's emphasis on salvation by faith alone. To the Lutherans, belief in Jesus Christ was all that was needed to go to Heaven, while the Catholic church emphasised showing your faith through good works. This debate highlighted one of the scandals of the church: 'good works' included almsgiving, and at times the Catholic church had used this to justify charging worshippers money for church services or to free souls from Purgatory. While both Lutherans and Catholics agreed this practise had to end, they were divided over how far to take it. Most Catholics continued to see good works as a necessary part of being Christian, while Lutherans went to the other extreme.\n\nDoctrinal decisions such as this were hotly debated in the church. Before a decision could be adopted, it had to be accepted by church leaders. This often demanded multiple councils agreeing on a doctrine. However, the higher church reform is, the more quickly the church will realise it has to take a stand."
 dg_pope.054.a: "Faith without works is dead"
 dg_pope.054.b: "Faith alone can save you"
 dg_pope.055.t: "The Counter Reformation"
 dg_pope.055.d: "The Lutheran Reformation was never intended to be a break from the Catholic church, but rather a wake-up call to its leadership that change was desperately needed. The church reacted by excommunicating reformers and their followers, giving them little choice but to break off from [the_vatican.GetCapitalName]. In church councils the papacy deliberately defined Catholicism in opposition to Lutheran doctrine, pushing the church even further away from compromise. Instead, the new focus of the church was to seek out and defeat heresy as it had many times before. The doctrinal debates of the Counter-Reformation helped to inspire ordinary Catholics to do just that."
 dg_pope.055.a: "There can be no compromise with heretics"
 dg_pope.056.t: "The Catholic Reformation"
 dg_pope.056.d: "The Lutheran Reformation was never intended to be a break from the Catholic church, but rather a wake-up call to its leadership that change was desperately needed. The hope of compromise was met by strong popes who purged the church of corruption and then redefined it by compromising with reformers. Response to this Catholic Reformation varied; moderates returned to the church, but radicals expressed their mistrust by growing even more virulently anti-Catholic. There was little room for a middle ground any longer. The waves of returning Catholics left the church with a problem, though: many Lutheran nobles had seized church lands, enriching themselves immeasurably. Others had taken advantage of the Reformation to grant themselves powers which they were reluctant to give up. Would it be wise to force them to give up these gains?"
 dg_pope.056.a: "Allow heretics to keep their stolen property"
 dg_pope.056.b: "Demand absolute submission to the church"
 dg_pope.058.t: "The Chinese Rites Controversy"
 dg_pope.058.d: "The Counter-Reformation sent Jesuit missionaries not only to heretic Europe, but also to heathens in Asia and the Americas. There they built churches, established schools and adapted local customs. To help persuade locals to convert, they allowed them to continue to venerate their ancestors, celebrate festivals and practise Confucian rituals.\n\nWhen rival orders of Dominican and Franciscan monks arrived, they were horrified at what they saw. Calling it heresy, they protested the Jesuit practise to local authorities, then to the pope."

 dg_pope.058.c: "The end justifies the means"
 dg_pope.064.t: "The [Root.Culture.GetName] faction"
 dg_pope.064.d: "With the death of the Pope, the College of Cardinals saw a chance to break the [From.GetAdjective] hold on the papacy. Seeking a plausible candidate, or 'papabile', they have thrown their support behind a [Root.GetAdjective] cardinal.\n\nThe election of a Pope was meant to be a time of personal reflection and prayer, but in practise often involved negotiation as factions emerged over multiple ballots. In the process, a [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] willing to spend influence could secure a Pope friendly to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] interests."
 dg_pope.064.a: "We should act quickly"
 dg_swiss.01.t: "Swiss Mercenaries"
 dg_swiss.01.d: "Beginning in the late fifteenth century Swiss mercenary soldiers served in the armies of foreign courts across Europe. Although not always the best forces, they had no local ties and could be counted on to be fanatically loyal to their employer. By the sixteenth century, Swiss mercenaries had become a common sight across Europe."
 dg_swiss.01.a: "Hire them to bolster our forces"
 dg_swiss.01.b: "We cannot rely on mercenaries"
 dg_swiss.02.t: "Swiss Guards"
 dg_swiss.02.d: "Swiss mercenary soldiers served not only as regular forces, but also as elite bodyguards, ceremonial forces and palace guards for the rulers of Europe. Countries as diverse as Savoy, Prussia and the Netherlands all established permanent Swiss guards in their capitals, and even the Pope relied on them as a personal bodyguard. Eventually the presence of Swiss guards was seen as a status symbol as much as a fighting force."

 dg_swiss.02.b: "We have no need for them"
 dg_swiss.03.t: "Swiss Mercenaries leave for $FROMCOUNTRY$"
 dg_swiss.03.d: "When their nation was at peace, some Swiss guards earned a living by hiring their troops out to foreign princes for their wars. The practise was a good way to keep a well-trained standing army and also to establish relationships with other countries. However some young men never returned to their homes."
 dg_swiss.03.a: "Send them off with fanfare"
 dg_swiss.03.b: "Forbid the practise from now on"
 dg_humanism.001.t: "Birth of the Renaissance"
 dg_humanism.001.d: "In fourteenth century Italy, a man named Petrarch founded Humanism when he claimed God had gifted man with intellect - and so any intellectual pursuit could be divine. This allowed artists and philosophers to appreciate classical Greek and Roman writers for their brilliance rather than condemning them for their paganism. The concurrent decline of Byzantium led to many Greek scholars fleeing west, where the church-sponsored translations of Greek texts into Latin. This made them accessible for the first time to the new, literate middle class that had arisen after the Black Death. This rediscovery of classical thinking led to an enthusiastic recovery of ancient Roman ideas and techniques that spread across Europe in a splendid flowering of culture."
 dg_humanism.001.a: "The glory of Rome revived!"
 dg_humanism.002.t: "The $PRIMARY_CULTURE$ Renaissance"
 dg_humanism.002.d: "A school of thought called Humanism spread out of Italy, claiming that since God gifted man with intellect, intellectual pursuit was divine. Happening at a time when Greek scholars fleeing the decline of Byzantium brought back ancient texts that the West had forgotten, this led to the rediscovery and appreciation of ancient Roman writers and artists for their brilliance, rather than their condemnation as pagans. The new, literate middle class that had arisen after the Black Death was just the audience to enthusiastically rediscover the glories of Rome, and this rebirth of classical culture spread across Europe in a splendid flowering of culture. However, the same ideas also led some to heresy: seeing the brilliance of ancient Rome, some Humanists began to believe that reason could justify their lack of faith and began to judge everything with reason - even the church itself."

 dg_humanism.004.d: "Roman ideas inspired many to re-examine the world around them by discarding their assumptions and start over with basic criteria. This new philosophy of 'humanism' began as a way to evaluate the worth of old books and introduce new techniques, but quickly spread to a way of criticising rulers, and even the church itself. Not all humanists disliked the church; many were devout Christians who hoped to blend humanist thinking with a reformed church. Others, however, dreamt of a world in which the church would not be as influential."

 dg_humanism.026.d: "The Renaissance was a period when the Greek and Roman classics were rediscovered and translated into Latin. In the middle ages, they had been shunned for being pagan, but now Humanist scholars evaluated them on their ideas rather than on their heresy. Ancient writers such as Plato, Socrates and Aristotle had much to say on topics such as ethics and politics, and those ideas were just as relevant in $YEAR$ as they had been two thousand years earlier.\n\nThe result was a flowering of philosophy, poetry and science as the ancient classics inspired modern interpretations. However, it was also a time of increased scepticism about religion. If a pagan who died long before Christ was born could use logic to determine good and evil, what did that say about the Bible?  To many $COUNTRY_ADJ$ philosophers, the answer was simple: being a good Christian meant following a code of ethics, not following the Bible. One could live an ethical life by being honest, hard-working, generous and kind without ever touching a relic, going on a pilgrimage or purchasing an indulgence. But then where did this leave the Church?"

Cistercian monks and nuns contemplated God in isolation from society. Their monasteries and abbeys often produced fine ales, cheeses and other goods which the monks traded for things they could not produce. The 'White Monks' reached their zenith in the fifteenth century, but went into a decline after that. Victims of their own success, the order found it difficult to maintain its zeal as it became mainstream."

 desc_lay_priesthood_aspect: "Our Church believes that all baptized members are equally capable of performing sacraments and preaching the Gospel.

However, they split from it when they adopted the doctrine that the Eucharist was a symbolic gesture rather than the literal body and blood of Christ. The movement was equally popular among the peasantry, who liked not having to pay tithes, and the nobility, who liked its message that the nobility should hold power over the church."
