 hee_POR.1.t:1 "Luís de Camões"
 hee_POR.1.d:1 "The national poet of Portugal, Luís de Camões was a sixteenth century lyricist, so famous for his writing that Portuguese is sometimes referred to as \"the language of Camões\"\n\nFollowing a humanist education, he spent much of his life abroad, first serving willingly in Ceuta where he lost one eye in battle, before being forced to serve in the militia in Goa to avoid prison. He kept on writing as he travelled, and did not even stop as he became chief warrant officer in Macau. His journeys were probably what inspired his most famous work, \"Os Lusíadas,\" an epic poem in the style of Homer about the Portuguese heroes of the age of exploration. The epic was mostly written in a grotto, and one story tells how de Camões was shipwrecked and swam ashore with one arm holding the poem above the water.\n\nWhile much of his work has been lost his genius was recognised in his time, and the day of his death, June 10th, is the national day of Portugal."
 hee_POR.1.a:1 "A greater poet there never was and never will be again."
 hee_POR.2.t:1 "The Return of King Sebastian!"
 hee_POR.2.d:1 "The line of Avis ended with the death of Sebastian the Child King on his crusade in Morocco, but the more than sixty years of Spanish rule that followed convinced many Portuguese that Sebastian was not truly dead, but would return one foggy day to free Portugal. This belief endured, and King Sebastian passed into legend as a sleeping hero, waiting for the day his country would need him again.\n\nOf course, a people expecting a saviour and an evil oppressive state meant that there was no shortage of people trying to capitalise on the stories. There were no less than four impostors claiming to be Sebastian while Portugal was subject to Spain.\n\nNow a young man claiming to be Sebastian has arrived in Lisboa. What shall we do with him?"
 hee_POR.2.a:1 "His name is Sebastian, that's good enough right now."
 hee_POR.2.b:1 "Throw this impostor in the dungeons!"
 hee_POL.9.t:1 "The Statutes of Nieszawa"
 hee_POL.9.d:1 "Przywilej cerekwicko-nieszawski were laws enacted in Poland in 1454, that gave the nobles, the szlachta, several privileges and concessions. The laws stated that the king required the approval of the nobles when issuing new laws, levying forces or introducing new taxes.\n\nThe reason king Casimir IV Jagiellon agreed to this was the need for support in the Thirteen Years War against the Teutonic Order. While the war led towards the absorption of the Teutonic lands into Poland, the Statutes of Nieszawa laid the groundwork for the coming conflicts between the king and the szlachta."
 hee_POL.9.a:1 "Accept the conventions."
 hee_POL.9.b:1 "Refuse to sign and defy the Magnates!"
 hee_POL.10.t:1 "Statutes of Piotrokow"
 hee_POL.10.d:1 "Konstytucje piotrkowskie was a collection of laws passed in 1496 under king John I Olbracht who, in the tradition of his forebears, made concessions to the szlachta in exchange for their support in war. The szlachta were guaranteed certain rights, including relief from specific taxes and exclusive access to some Church offices.\n\nThe laws also affected the situation of peasants in the country, restricting them to their lands. After 1496, only one peasant from each village could leave per year, and only one person from a given peasant family was allowed to move to the growing towns. City burghers were also restricted from holding royal and national offices.\n\nFinally, the statues emphasised the rivers of Poland, removing all internal tariffs on waterways."
 hee_POL.10.a:1 "Enact as the szlachta require."
 hee_POL.10.b:1 "The king will not be forced!"
 hee_POL.11.t:1 "Union of Vilnius"
 hee_POL.11.d:1 "Unia krakowsko-wileñska was an attempt at taking a major step in the unification of Poland and Lithuania. It was signed by both Polish and Lithuanian nobles in 1499, and described two equal states in perpetual alliance. The countries would select their own leaders with the approval of the other, but would always support each other in armed conflicts.\n\nHowever, the Union did not last long in that state. Polish nobles soon began to protest it, mainly because it emphasised Lithuania as much as Poland. The reasoning they gave however, was that it was based on an old union of 1413, which they claimed there was no evidence for."
 hee_POL.11.a:1 "Our countries should cooperate."
 hee_POL.11.b:1 "Our countries are better off as just friends."
 hee_POL.12.t:1 "The Privilege of Mielnik"
 hee_POL.12.d:1 "The Przywilej mielnicki was an act passed by king Alexander Jagiellon in 1501, that expanded the powers of the magnates and the Sejm, to the point where it practically introduced a republican form of government. The king lost many rights, and was effectively demoted to the head of the Sejm, which held all real power.\n\nHowever, after being elected as head of the Sejm, the king never confirmed the privileges, and it gradually became apparent that the struggle between the king and the greater Sejm harmed the nobles more than the new status quo helped them.\n\nIn 1504, the legal change was rejected by the Sejm, and while the struggle between the nobles and the king would continue for a long time, this battle had ended in Alexander's favour."
 hee_POL.12.a:1 "Grant the privilege."
 hee_POL.12.b:1 "Reject these outrageous demands!"
 hee_POL.13.t:1 "The Union of Mielnik"
 hee_POL.13.d:1 "The Unia mielnicka was one of the first attempts to unite Poland and Lithuania into a single state. Previously the two countries had coexisted in personal union through the king, but the Union of Mielnik would unite them into a single entity. The suggestion of the union was not well-received in Lithuania, as Polish magnates were attempting to force Polish culture and traditions onto the other country, and nobles there led a revolt against the Poles. In the end, the union was neither ratified by the Lithuanian Seimas or the Polish Sejm, and the countries remained separate in personal union for nearly seventy years more before they were finally united."
 hee_POL.13.a:1 "Unite our nations under Poland. (This will cause massive revolts among the Lithuanians.)"
 hee_POL.13.b:1 "Don't force anyone to sign this."
 hee_POL.14.t:1 "Lithuanians Revolt Against the Union"
 hee_POL.14.d:1 "After the introduction of the Union of Mielnik, Lithuanian nobles have banded together in massive numbers to rise up against their Polish counterparts. Through the union, magnates have insisted on instituting Polish language in education and bureaucracy, as well as rule by Polish traditions. Now the Lithuanians have decided to fight back with arms."
 hee_POL.14.a:1 "You were warned."
 hee_POL.15.t:1 "1504 Reforms Passed Before the King"
 hee_POL.15.d:1 "In 1504, the Sejm piotrowski passed measures to restrict the king's control over the national treasury, effectively placing the Sejm in control of state funds.\n\nThe Sejm did not get the measures passed without negotiation, however. Nobles were from now on forbidden from holding more than a single official administrative post. In addition, Polish magnates had to return much land that had previously been seized from the king, thereby compensating somewhat for the financial authority the king lost."
 hee_POL.15.a:1 "You lose some, you... win some?"
 hee_POL.16.t:1 "Nothing New Without the Common Consent"
 hee_POL.16.d:1 "Nihil novi nisi commune consensu was an act adopted by the Sejm in 1505 at Radom. It forbade the king to issue laws without the consent of the nobility. This consent would be given through the Senat and the Chamber of Deputies.\n\nThe only exceptions were laws governing royal cities, crown lands, mines, fiefdoms, royal peasants, and Jews. These exceptions can be traced by the meaning of the law's name in Polish, \"Nothing About Us Without Us.\""
 hee_POL.16.a:1 "The nobles can be of great aid."
 hee_POL.16.b:1 "This is too far! No more power to the nobles!"
 hee_POL.17.t:1 "The Privilege of Torun"
 hee_POL.17.d:1 "Przywilej toruñski was enacted in 1520 by the Polish king, granting the szlachta greater control over people living on their lands. Peasants were forced to pay serfdom to their masters, and prevented them from leaving their villages. This was a part of the greater trend of introducing serfdom in Eastern Europe at the time, as encouraging peasant settlers was no longer considered as necessary at it had been in earlier centuries. The Privilege defined Polish serfdom for the next century, before it gradually declined under the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. After nearly three centuries, the state's attitude would reverse into constitutional state protection for all peasants."
 hee_POL.17.a:1 "Serfdom is the way of the future!"
 hee_POL.17.b:1 "We can't give these predatory nobles more power."
 hee_POL.18.t:1 "The Prussian Homage"
 hee_POL.18.d:1 "Hołd pruski was the investment of the former Grand Master of the Teutonic Order as Duke of Prussia under the Polish crown.\n\nPoland required every new Grand Master of the Order to pay homage to the king, and a refusal to do so had resulted in lasting conflict between the Order and Poland, culminating in the Polish-Teutonic War. The war dragged on, and with renewed incursions of the Ottomans into Christian lands, the two states agreed to an armistice that would see the Teutonic Order secularised into a Polish dukedom. In the main square of Krakow, Albert publicly resigned as Grand Master before receiving the title Duke of Prussia from King Zygmunt the Old."
 hee_POL.18.a:1 "Establish Prussia as a royal fief."
 hee_POL.18.b:1 "The Order serves our purpose."
 hee_POL.19.t:1 "Tumult of Danzig"
 hee_POL.19.d:1 "The Tumult gdanski was a 1525 revolt by Lutheran burghers against the mayor of Danzig, Eberhard Ferber. The mayor was suspected of defrauding money from the city under the protection of the Crown Chancellor. As the revolt developed it took on a religious tone, and even though the mayor resigned, the refusal of the Chancellor to show the city accounts meant that riots continued.\n\nThe Lutheran burghers closed Catholic churches and introduced their own preachers to replace pastors. As the city came under their control, the commoners demanded the removal of the city from the jurisdiction of the local bishop, and a delegation sent to Martin Luther asked the priest to send teachers of the new faith.\n\nHowever, a year after the tumult started and two months after the burghers had seized complete control of the city, King Sigismund and the prince of Pomerania led an army into the city, putting down the revolt and beheading its leaders, restoring the old order to Danzig."
 hee_POL.19.a:1 "These people must be stopped at all costs!"
 hee_POL.19.b:1 "Live and let live."
 hee_POL.20.t:1 "The Treaty of Vilnius"
 hee_POL.20.d:1 "The Pakt wileñski was concluded between the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Livonian Confederation in 1561, during the Livonian War. With the exception of the Free Imperial City of Riga, the Treaty brought all the Livonian states that were not occupied by Denmark or Sweden under the suzerainty of the Commonwealth. It also secularised the Livonian Order into the Duchy of Courland and Semigalla and the Duchy of Livonia.\n\nWhile the treaty finally lost Livonia its independence, in the eyes of the Polish state it rescued the Livonian lands from Russian aggression and inevitable conquest."
 hee_POL.20.a:1 "Incorporate Livonia, for their own good."
 hee_POL.20.b:1 "We don't have the capacity to administer those lands."
 hee_POL.21.t:1 "Karnkowski's Statute"
 hee_POL.21.d:1 "Statut karnkowskiego was a law enacted in 1570 by Stanislav Karnkowski, the bishop of Kujawy and Great Secretary of the Crown. The law gave the Polish king full authority over all matters of the sea, with the intention of improving Poland's naval capabilities in the Baltic Sea. The act led to extensive naval development in Danzig, but had no great effect beyond that due to the death of king Sigismund II August died, and the fact that his successor had little interest in competing for naval supremacy."
 hee_POL.21.a:1 "Expand the rights of the king."
 hee_POL.21.b:1 "We don't need this."
 hee_POL.22.t:1 "The Prussian Homage"
 hee_POL.22.d:1 "The Prussian Homage was the investment of the former Grand Master of the Teutonic Order as the duke of the secularised Ducal Prussia, a fief under the Polish Crown.\n\nThis fit well with Albert of Prussia's newfound Lutheranism, as it allowed Prussia to no longer be a subject of the papacy.\n\nIt seems that our overlord has similarly decided that it is time we came properly under their wing as a secular duchy."
 hee_POL.22.a:1 "Humble before the Polish King."
 hee_POL.23.t:1 "The Treaty of Vilnius"
 hee_POL.23.d:1 "The Pakt wileñski was concluded between the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Livonian Confederation in 1561, during the Livonian War. With the exception of the Free Imperial City of Riga, the Treaty brought all the Livonian states that were not occupied by Denmark or Sweden under the suzerainty of the Commonwealth. It also secularised the Livonian Order into the Duchy of Courland and Semigalla and the Duchy of Livonia.\n\nWhile the treaty finally lost Livonia its independence, in the eyes of the Polish state it rescued the Livonian lands from Russian aggression and inevitable conquest."
 hee_POL.23.a:1 "Poland can protect us."
 hee_POL.23.b:1 "We are stronger on our own!"
 hee_PER.1.t:1 "The Qizilbash"
 hee_PER.1.d:1 "The Qizilbash were a conglomeration of Turkoman tribes from Asia Minor who helped Shah Ismail conquer Persia and champion their Shiite faith as the head of the Safavid dynasty. While they revered Ismail as a saint, the fact that the unruly clans were the foundation of Persian power would lead to more than a century of internal struggles."
 hee_PER.1.a:1 "They are here for us now, that is all that matters."
 hee_PER.2.t:1 "The Qizilbash Lend Their Support"
 hee_PER.2.d:1 "The rise of Persia was bought with the blood of Qizilbash warriors. With our armies marching to take back the land that is rightfully ours, a council of chieftains have sent us an additional contingent of soldiers."
 hee_PER.2.a:1 "United for the Shah!"
 hee_PER.2.b:1 "Ask for their guidance."
 hee_PER.3.t:1 "The Qizilbash Fight For Power"
 hee_PER.3.d:1 "Although Shah Ismail was practically worshipped by the Qizilbash tribesmen who had won him Persia, his successors were not to be so fortunate. With the passing of each Shah, the tribes would use intrigue and violence to fight over which candidate was the rightful successor."
 hee_PER.3.a:1 "Long Live the Shah!"
 hee_PER.3.b:1 "Let us ensure the loyalty of the tribes."
 hee_PER.4.t:1 "Qizilbash Plot!"
 hee_PER.4.d:1 "In the early years of the Safavid dynasty, the Shah would curb Qizilbash power by appointing Iranians to high offices. To ensure their own position in the kingdom, the Turkomans would rarely let these appointments stand. If political manoeuvring didn't help, it was not uncommon to resort to murder...\nIt seems that our latest choice was an unpopular one."
 hee_PER.4.a:1 "The situation will only get worse if we interfere."
 hee_PER.4.b:1 "We will not be slaves to the whim of the tribes!"
 hee_PER.5.t:1 "Pressure From the Qizilbash"
 hee_PER.5.d:1 "Some of the more powerful Qizilbash tribes are protesting our recent policies. While they claim to acknowledge the power of the Shah, they are eager to point out what would happen if he loses their support."
 hee_PER.5.a:1 "Let them have their way."
 hee_PER.5.b:1 "Resist every way we can!"
 hee_PER.5.c:1 "Those who oppose us will be driven out!"
 hee_PER.6.t:1 "The Third Force"
 hee_PER.6.d:1 "As the result of campaigns in Georgia and Armenia in the late sixteenth century, Caucasian slaves were brought to Persia in their tens of thousands. They became valued soldiers and royal servants, but it was not until Shah Abbas the Great that they became a political force of their own, loyal only to the Shah. Abbas expanded their army regiments and ensured them positions in the royal administration, and soon many of them were among Persia's highest ranking officers and administrators. Over time, this third political force would ensure the decline of the Qizilbash."
 hee_PER.6.a:1 "We need them to reform our society!"
 hee_PER.6.b:1 "The Qizilbash is no threat to the Shah."
 hee_PER.7.t:1 "End of Tribal Independence"
 hee_PER.7.d:1 "After more than a century of political struggle with the Shah, changes in Persian society spelled the end of Qizilbash power. While the Turkoman tribes were still an important part of Persia, their leaders no longer ruled as independent chieftains, and they would never again get to choose their Shah. Although Persia continued to struggle with rebellions, these would not be led by chieftains, but by self-styled kings."
 hee_PER.7.a:1 "No-one will ever hold Persia hostage again!"
 hee_PER.8.t:1 "Decline of the Qizilbash"
 hee_PER.8.d:1 "After centuries of infighting, the Qizilbash were overtaken by centralisation and modern statesmanship. The violent intrigues of the tribes made way for new governing forces, and Persia became a more centralised kingdom. While rebellions would continue to frequently challenge the Shah, they no longer came from the Qizilbash."
 hee_PER.8.a:1 "It is time Persia looked to the future."
 hee_PAP.1.t:1 "Great Indulgence Salesman"
 hee_PAP.1.d:1 "One of our indulgence salesmen, appointed by the Pope himself after demonstrating his great skill and providing a generous donation, has turned out to be excellent at his job! Some even dare say a little too good.\n\nCertainly, some of the things he claims indulgences can do - such as buying a close relative out of purgatory, or make up for sins not yet committed - might not be entirely correct, but it does do the trick. Both rich and poor, bishops and farmers, nuns and harlots, are all lining up to line our coffers. We protect their eternal souls, after all."
 hee_PAP.1.a:1 "This man could sell indulgences to Saint Peter!"
 hee_PAP.1.b:1 "We should restrict some of his less pious tactics."
 hee_PAL.1.t:1 "Johann Wilhelm II, Elector Palatine"
 hee_PAL.1.d:1 "Johann Wilhelm II was the Elector Palatine that oversaw somewhat of a restoration of the Palatinate. Under his rule, the Palatinate regained territory previously lost to France and Bavaria thanks to a number of treaties. However, the conditions of these included the demand that the Palatinate, a member state of the Holy Roman Empire with a significant portion of protestants, should not revert to Lutheranism. Johann Wilhelm II agreed to these demands, but instead passed laws declaring religious toleration for all citizens in the Palatinate."
 hee_PAL.1.a:1 "A man deserving of his electorate."
 hee_NUM.1.t:1 "The Emperor's First Diet"
 hee_NUM.1.d:1 "Ever since the Golden Bull of 1356, the King of the Germans, the Holy Roman Emperor, is required to hold his first imperial diet in our grand city of Nürnberg.\n\nThe most recently elected emperor has finally gotten around to calling the diet, and as required by tradition and law, every notable prince and bishop will come with him."
 hee_NUM.1.a:1 "This will benefit us greatly."
 hee_NOR.1.t:1 "Copper Mines of Røros"
 hee_NOR.1.d:1 "In the 1600s, several copper mines were established in the area around the town of Røros. While it initially provided a poor yield, eventually the valuable veins would open for mining, and soon the mining company was financially secure. The seventeenth and eighteenth centuries would see the continued expansion of the mines, and the development of local industry to support them."
 hee_NOR.1.a:1 "Dig deep and greedily."
 hee_NOR.1.b:1 "Sell off the mining rights."
 hee_NOR.2.t:1 "The Norwegians Pray to Saint Olav"
 hee_NOR.2.d:1 "The body of Saint Olaf, the king who Christened Norway, was kept in a lavish shrine in the Cathedral of Nidaros.\nFollowing the reformation, it became a problem that peasants and lords alike prayed to this human saint, and in 1536 Danish authorities ruined the shrine, seizing the valuable parts of the coffin for the state.\n\nIf we were to do this, we would be doing the Norwegians a favour, as their prayers to their ancient king go unheard."
 hee_NOR.2.a:1 "Destroy the shrine and seize the valuables."
 hee_NOR.2.b:1 "Let them pray to whatever they want. God will sort them out."
 hee_NOR.3.t:1 "The [From.GetAdjective] Have Destroyed the Shrine of Saint Olav!"
 hee_NOR.3.d:1 "Authorities in [From.GetName] have decided that our veneration of Saint Olav, the holy king who Christened Norway, is a betrayal of their new faith! They have sent soldiers to Nidaros, where they have torn apart the shrine containing the body of the king.\nIt used to be a popular destination for pilgrims, and this attack is a severe blow to our faith and our history.\nWhile they say it was done to protect our eternal souls, the valuable parts of the lavish shrine were torn off and sent to [From.GetName]"
 hee_NOR.3.a:1 "How dare they?!"
 hee_NED.1.t:1 "$PROVINCE$ Named Generality Lands"
 hee_NED.1.d:1 "Due to the challenges of administrating the population of $PROVINCE$, the States-General has decided to name the region Generaliteitslande, or \"Generality Lands.\" This means that instead of being subject to one of the seven United Provinces, it will be governed directly by the States-General itself.\n\nThese regions are not represented in the central government - which might be best, considering their beliefs - and have no States-Provincial of their own.\n\nOne day we might have reason to let them be represented and govern themselves, but for now holding them as a dependant territory is best."

 hee_NED.2.d:1 "After showing signs of development and stability, the region of $PROVINCE$ has finally been granted the right to its own administration.

 hee_NAP.1.d:1 "Pedro Alvarez de Toledo was the first viceroy of Naples to effectively govern the kingdom on behalf of the Spanish crown. While issuing grand construction projects and modernising the country, part of the reason for his success was his firm rule and ruthlessness. Where previous viceroys had failed to exert control over the kingdom, \"Don Pedro\" closed down humanist institutions and instituted harsh penalties for petty crimes. He centralised national institutions, and moved every court to the Castel Capuano. By breaking up traditional land holdings, barons were forced to move to the city where they would be within reach of de Toledo's government.\n\nHe failed in introducing the Spanish Inquisition in Naples, however, as revolts forced the Spanish king to retract the order. De Toledo passed away shortly after, in 1552, while on state business in Siena, ensuring that his legacy of state building would forever outshine the harshness of his rule."

The old walls were expanded and new ones were built along the seafront. Fortresses, shipyards and barracks were modernised and expanded. He also commissioned a new palace for the Viceroy, which was then surrounded by buildings in square-grid streets. The Spanish Quarter, as it was called, was the first of its kind in Europe, and is still one of the most distinct areas of Naples. The express goal was to make Naples invulnerable, but it also had the side effect of making it the second largest city in Europe at the time. By his death in 1552, the legacy of the harsh ruler as a city-builder was more than secure, and Naples would continue to be a centre of southern European power for centuries."

 hee_NAP.3.d:1 "The cave that would become the Fontanelle cemetery had for hundreds of years been used as a charnel house for old remains, which had been moved from graveyards in Naples to make space for citizens insisting on being interred near their churches. In the late seventeenth century, however, a series of floods caused remains to be washed from the cave into the streets of Naples. The grisly sight of skulls grinning up at them and bones resting in their gutters made the citizens realise that something had to be done to accommodate the ever-growing population."

 hee_NAP.4.t:1 "Ospedale di San Gennaro dei Poveri"
 hee_NAP.4.d:1 "The San Gennaro dei Poveri was the very first hospice for the poor in Naples, a city that in 1667, when the hospice was built, struggled with overpopulation and severe poverty. The ancient building had been renovated and repurposed multiple times, from a plague hospital in the seventeenth century to a monastery in the eighteenth century, before it found a new purpose as a poor house. While it could never house all of the estimated 10,000 destitute people in the city at the time, it was the first in a long tradition of hospices for the poor in Naples."

 hee_NAP.5.t:1 "Ospedale L'Albergo Reale dei Poveri"
 hee_NAP.5.d:1 "The Albergo Reale dei Poveri was an enormous hospice for the poor in Naples from 1751. The institution was intended to not just provide care to the ill, but provide an entire self-sufficient community of the poor where they could live and work. At times its five stories would house as many as five thousand people, relieving some of the pressure poverty placed on the city of Naples. The building was designed by the famous architect Ferdinando Fuga, which was how it got its nickname \"Palazzo Fuga\"."

 hee_NAP.6.d:1 "Francesco Solimena, who lived from 1657 to 1747, was a Neapolitan painter who came to define the Baroque style in southern Italy. He trained and worked with his painter father, Angelo Solimena, and is famous for decorating churches with him, including the cathedral of Nocera. On his own, Francesco would become renown for painting frescoes in his signature dark, detailed and dramatically lit style. As Francesco's reputation grew, his atelier became a gathering point of painter students from across Naples, and he provided tutelage for many of Italy's most famous baroque painters."

 hee_WAL.3.t:1 "The Cathedral of Curta de Arges"
 hee_WAL.3.d:1 "Curta de Arges, the old capital of Wallachia, became the site of a large cathedral in the beginning of the sixteenth century. Finished in 1517 and restored in 1885, the building is dedicated to Saint Nicholas, and was a centre of Orthodox Christianity in Wallachia throughout its existence.\n\nIt has inspired many stories and legends, one of which states that a prince designed a magnificent mosque for the Sultan that impressed the ruler of the Ottomans so that the prince was allowed to take the leftover material with him. It was from that the equally magnificent cathedral was first built."

 hee_WAL.4.t:1 "Changing the Seat of Power"
 hee_WAL.4.d:1 "Targoviste had been the capital of Wallachia for a relatively short time when, in 1659, George Ghica moved the capital to Bucharest.\n\nEver since the fifteenth century, Bucharest had been known as the strongest citadel in Wallachia, and was a favoured place of living for Wallachian princes. As the city was continually expanded and developed over the sixteenth century, trade and political importance in the country shifted further and further south. Soon, Bucharest was the most populous city in the princedom, and with the diminishing importance of Targoviste, moving the royal court became inevitable."

Despite our best efforts to make them understand how beneficial our rule has been for them, the dream of an independent Marathi kingdom is stronger than ever before.\n\nThis desire has allowed a Marathi warrior by the name of Shivaji to raise a small army. Some of our unprepared forts were quickly overrun, and he already dares claim the title of \"Raj\".\n\nWe must show this Marathi \"kingdom\" the price of disloyalty."

It is said that with blood pouring from his mouth, the general cursed the name of \"[Root.Monarch.GetName]\". To the Marathas storming over the hill to ambush the general's troops, it was a battlecry.\n\nThe enemy army shattered in moments."

They were to meet with only one bodyguard, and no other weapons but a sword each. Thus they would find a solution to the war and stop the bloodshed.\n\nA peaceful solution appears not to interest our enemy, however. With metal tiger claws hidden underneath his armour, [From.Monarch.GetName] struck at our loyal general, murdering him in a holy place.\n\nTo make matters worse, an army of Marathas poured forth from hiding, slaying those of our soldiers who hoped for the war to end that day.\n\nSuch a betrayal must never be allowed to happen again."

 hee_MAR.7.t:1 "[From.GetName] Relies on Foreign Weaponry"
 hee_MAR.7.d:1 "We have time and time again been denied trade with the westerners in India, and now the reason is clear. [From.GetName] is attempting to monopolise European weaponry, and the Europeans are playing along. Not only has [From.GetName] acquired new, trained artillery, they have also employed western soldiers still fighting under the banner of their home country!\n\nWith a raid on a European factory or trade store, we too could secure these tools of war."

 hee_KOR.1.d:1 "Hangul is the Korean alphabet created in 1443 and promulgated in the 1446 work \"Huminjeongeum\", or \"The Proper Sounds For the Instruction of the People.\"\n\nSponsored by Sejong the Great and probably created by the Hall of Worthies, the new script was meant as a replacement for the Chinese characters used in Korea at the time, which was inefficient for expressing the Korean language. They were made easy, so that even a commoner could learn to read and write them. \"A wise man can acquaint himself with them before the morning is over. A stupid man in the space of ten days.\"\n\nThis would eventually lead to such a high literacy rate among those of lower birth that a paranoid king banned the use of Hangul in 1504. However, use did not stop entirely, and in the late sixteenth century Hangul saw a revival and quickly became the dominant alphabet in Korea."

 hee_KOR.2.d:1 "King Danjong rose to the throne when he was merely twelve, and would only rule for two years. His uncle, and brother of the former king, Sejo, usurped his throne and seized the kingdom for himself. After a failed assassination attempt by ministers loyal to Danjong, Sejo had them and the former king killed.\n\nDespite his ruthlessness, or possibly because of his unstoppable daring, he was a successful ruler, centralising the country and encouraging the publication of books on history, economics and religion. He was also a great military strategist, and attacked the Jurchen tribes of the north multiple times.\n\nMost famously, in 1468 he established the first form of constitutional law in Korea, the Grand Code for State Administration."

 hee_KOR.3.d:1 "During the rise of the Joseon dynasty, the neo-Confucian scholar Gil Jae had retreated to his home town, where he educated a generation of new scholars.\n\nKing Seongjong invited these Sarim scholars and their followers to the capital. There they served in the Three Offices near the king, and challenged the established order of officials.\n\nOver time, a mix of scholarly conflicts and purges would divide the Sarim into sub-factions, and their conflicts had strong influence on not just Korean intellectual life, but the king himself."

 hee_KOR.4.t:1 "Censured by the Office of Censors"
 hee_KOR.4.d:1 "The Office of Censors was one of the Three Offices, the government councils meant to keep the Korean balance of power. The task of the Office of Censors is to review major royal decisions and decrees, and ask the king to withdraw them if they are improper.\n\nNow they have set their sights on one of the king's latest decrees, and it happens to be an important one as well."
 hee_KOR.4.a:1 "Convince the Office that the decree is not un-Confucian."
 hee_KOR.4.b:1 "Ignore the Office. They are only there to advise, after all."
 hee_KOR.5.t:1 "Hyangyak"
 hee_KOR.5.d:1 "Hyangyak was a contractual agreement between the state and early forms of local government in Korea. The relationship gave local regions greater autonomy, but only because they were governed by a local representative of the king. These were the Yangban.\nThe Yangban were a wide group of local aristocrats, who administered the regional bureaucracy. While the status of Yangban was hereditary, the rights and duties of the hyangyak were not passed on by inheritance, but rather by passing state exams. This ensured competent control on every level of the country's hierarchy.\n\nUnless it was unfortunate with its king, of course."

 hee_KOR.6.d:1 "Jo Gwangjo was the consummate seonbi - a virtuous scholar, one of the 18 Sages of Korea, and a reformer active in Korea in the early sixteenth century. His wisdom let him rise to great heights within the Korean hierarchy, where he attempted to reform the recruitment system for new officials.\n\nHe meant that the current tests were too literate, and did not represent the practical skills required in government work. Many older scholars were outraged by these attempts to change the system that had brought them where they were, and matters were made worse when Jo Gwangjo also attempted to remove special privileges, as well as establishing local self-government through the Hyangyak system. Topping it off with a land reform that aimed at reducing the disparity between rich and poor left Gwangjo with many powerful enemies.\n\nIn the end he was forced to drink poison, and most of his reforms were reversed after his death. However, Jo Gwangjo would go down in Korean history as one of its greatest scholars."

She quickly made an impression at court, and became known for her wit and skill as an orator.\n\nMore than four decades later, following multiple other kings, she became regent for the young King Sunjo, as she held seniority over everyone else in the palace. In that role she pushed for the Catholic Persecution of 1801, where Korean Catholics were persecuted and killed or banished.\n\nFollowing years of rule, Jeongsun willingly gave up the power once the king came of age in 1804."

 hee_KOR.8.t:1 "The Silhak Movement"
 hee_KOR.8.d:1 "The Silhak Movement was a long-term direction of thought, spanning centuries of Korean history, from the late sixteenth century onwards.\n\nSilhaks were hoping to change society to get away from the extreme metaphysical nature of Neo-Confucianism, which held little correspondence to the life of Koreans in a quickly changing world.\nThe Silhak movement's supporters wanted to change Korean society to match changes in other areas of life. They pushed for land reforms, stronger focus on Korean national identity, and the abandonment of the rigid Confucian societal structure.\nThese changes were meant to come by through a more realistic and experimental approach to social problems, with the consideration of the welfare of the people, and human equality. The Silhak movement is today considered an important step in the creation of a modern Korea."
 hee_KOR.8.a:1 "I have my doubts, but maybe they can teach us something."
 hee_KOR.9.t:1 "Silhak Scholars Back Westernisation"
 hee_KOR.9.d:1 "A number of Silhak scholars in the state apparatus have banded together in agreement over our recent westwards-looking policies. While they see Enlightenment science as a way of evolving their own empirical-based form of Confucianism, westernisation more than anything presents a path to marking out Korea as a historical entity of its own, not quite as tied to the traditions of its neighbours."

 hee_KOR.10.t:1 "Yi Sun-sin"
 hee_KOR.10.d:1 "With no naval education, Yi Sun-sin went undefeated in every naval battle he commanded against Japanese invasion forces between 1592 and 1598.\n\nHe is famous for resurrecting and perfecting the design of the Korean turtle ships, giving him an edge in battle. His fleet would frequently be outnumbered, but thanks to his brilliant strategies and quick thinking he always came out on top.\n\nHe received a hero's death, being wounded by a bullet in the naval battle that finally forced the Japanese to abandon Korea. Even as he died, he gave his last order, to not announce his death and let the war drums keep beating. The Koreans carried the day, and Admiral Yi passed into history as one of the greatest naval commanders of all time."

 hee_KOR.11.d:1 "In 1653, the Dutch trading ship De Sperwer shipwrecked off the coast of Korea on a trading mission to Japan. 36 crew members survived and were taken care of in Korea, although they were not allowed to leave due to Korea's strict anti-foreigner policies.\n\nOne of the surviving sailors was Hendrick Hamel, who stayed a captive in Korea for 13 years. The king expected Hamel and the other sailors to lend their expertise in producing muskets to the military, even though they were not technicians.\n\nIn 1666, after 13 years in captivity, Hamel and some other sailors managed to escape the country and return to the Netherlands with the help of another trading mission in Japan. Once home, Hamel published the first western account of Korea in \"Hamel's Journal and a Description of the Kingdom of Korea, 1653-1666.\""

As the king finally stamped out the last vestiges of resistance, the conflicts still seemed to simmer just under the surface.\nIn order to counter regionalism and centralise the kingdom, the capital was moved to Ngazargamu where a fortress city was built.

In addition to being a social reformer, he achieved great military successes against Kanem Bornu's enemies, such as Hausa and the Tuaregs. These victories were in part thanks to his employment of military innovations such as walled military camps, permanent sieges and scorched earth tactics.\n\nThe heroic epic that was written about him describes how he won over a thousand victories in more than three hundred and thirty wars during his reign."

His reforms were based on Islamic law, and included the establishment of a royal advisory council consisting of the heads of the largest clan in the kingdom.\nAluma also relied heavily on slaves educated in noble homes as administrators, and he required anyone of political significance to live at his court, so that the kingdom could be governed efficiently. He improved the road system and built wells along them, introduced new boat designs to Lake Chad, introduced a standard measure for grain, and moved farmers to new, more fertile lands."

 hee_HUN.9.d:1 "Fekete Sereg (The Black Army) was the military force established by Matthias Corvinus, and was active between 1458-1494. The revolutionary approach that made The Black Army such a formidable fighting force, in addition to early adaptation of gunpowder weapons, was the fact that its soldiers were well-paid, full-time mercenaries, purely devoted to warfare. Whereas most mercenaries would return to their farm or workshop between wars, the men of the Black Army kept practising the art of war.\n\nUnder Matthias, the army conquered large parts of Austria, and more than half of Bohemia."

At its height, there were more than 3,000 codices, called \"Corvinae\" in honour of the king, which covered every subject matter from philosophy to architecture. Its content was thought to be second only to the Vatican Library in Rome, and cemented Corvinus as a man of learning as well as a warrior.\n\nThe library was destroyed during the Ottoman invasions in 1526, and most of the works were lost."

 hee_GOT.2.d:1 "The inhabitants of Gotland have always been suspicious of foreigners, but the foreign overlords has traditionally acknowledged our god-given right to rule it. However, this time they have gone too far! By changing their laws, they have stripped a Thing, a gathering of influentials that will act as the final word in matters of the law from its prerogatives. This is clearly spitting in the face of our authority!"

 hee_GOT.3.d:1 "The inhabitants of Gotland have always been suspicious of foreigners, and we have traditionally acknowledged their right to rule the island according to their customs.

 hee_GEN.1.d:1 "A lighthouse had kept watch over Genoa for centuries, but it wasn't until 1543 construction finished on what would become known as the Lanterna, the tallest lighthouse in the world for more than 350 years. Standing at the edge of the city, overlooking the entrance to the harbour, the lighthouse guided ships safely to land. Thanks to the relative safety of Genoese waters, many foreign traders made the city their port of choice, and so helped Genoa prosper through the ages."

 hee_GEN.2.t:1 "Sampiero Corso"
 hee_GEN.2.d:1 "Living from 1498 to 1567, Sampiero Corso was a Corsican lower noble and soldier. He grew up to become a condottieri, and fought for several paymasters in Italy. Eventually he came into the service of the French king, where his familiarity with Corsica became an advantage to the French efforts in Italy.\n\nNow it seems that our ruthless enemies in France has chosen to send Sampiero Corso in an attempt to free Corsica for later French occupation!"

 hee_GEN.3.t:1 "The Corsican Constitution"
 hee_GEN.3.d:1 "Inspired by Enlightenment thinkers, Pasquale Paoli draughted a constitution for the independent Republic of Corsica in 1755. Sponsored by Great Britain, Paoli not only managed to drive the Genoese off the island, but also reorganised the government into a functioning state, complete with a university and its own mint. Although the republic would fall to France in 1769, Paolis reforms advanced the island significantly, and international recognition of the Corsican people as a distinct culture."
 hee_GEN.3.a:1 "Of course, none of this will happen if we can help it."
 hee_GEN.4.t:1 "Casa San Giorgio on Corsica"
 hee_GEN.4.d:1 "The distance from Genoa to Corsica was an administrative challenge, and war or local dissent could make it impossible for the doge to exert any political power on the island. As the Bank of Saint George became a major creditor for Genoa, they acquired the right to collect taxes on Corsica, provided they also protected the island.\n\nWhile the bank treated Genoese settlers preferentially over locals, it did much to develop the island, especially the towns and fortifications along the coast. However, the bank's taxation would eventually grow to wear as heavily on the locals as the republic's had, and provided the driving force of the Corsican movement to replace Genoese authority with French."

With the words \"Am I to begin?\" he threw it at one of the soldiers. The crowd instantly turned on the occupying force.\n\nOver the course of just a few days, the foreign soldiers were evicted from the city, and Genoa was once again free.

With the accursed words \"Am I to begin?\" he threw it at one of the soldiers.

 hee_FRA.1.d:1 "Sampiero Corso was a member of the lower Corsican nobility who sought his fortune as an Italian Condottieri. His exploits would eventually bring him into the service of the French king, for which he was granted the governorship of Aix-en-Provence. In 1553, however, during France's war with Genoa, Sampiero Corso returned to Corsica to lead a rebellion against the Genoese. Although he was successful in securing Corsica's allegiance to France, the island would be returned to Genoa in the peace treaty of Cateau Cambrésis between France and Spain in 1559."
 hee_FRA.1.a:1 "A Corsican rebellion can only be good for us!"
 hee_FRA.2.t:1 "Poor Internal Toll System"
 hee_FRA.2.d:1 "In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, France had dozens of different laws for how different goods were to be taxed when transported between provinces. To make matters worse, different laws applied to different provinces, causing multiple tolls to be paid by merchants travelling across the country. Not only did this discourage trade and transportation, it made it so that it was often cheaper to import goods from abroad, rather than from a neighbouring city.\nIt was also up to local signeurs to apply the taxation laws, which meant that there was no regulation on lords that charged far more than they legally should. In the middle of the eighteenth century, it was estimated that the cost of transporting 500 livres worth of wine from Muret to Paris was 501 livres, paying for dozens of tolls along the way. The provincial regulations meant that the same amount of salt could cost twenty times as much on one side of a river as on the other."

Humans know more now than we ever have before, and yet the only thing we are certain of is that there are so many answers yet to find.\n\nNevertheless, every year sees new discoveries and ideas, and philosophers are no longer just developing traditions, but ideas and worldviews.\n\nWith these developments happening in our country as well as across Europe, we have entered the Age of Enlightenment."

Ideas developed by modern philosophers can aid our bureaucracy and lend even greater legitimacy to our absolute rule. On the other hand, some of them speak of terrifying things like self-determination and pluralistic governments."

 hee_enlightenment.4.d:1 "In our modern day and age, the methods of the natural scientists of antiquity are coming up short. No longer is thinking and imagining the universe enough to discover the truth. Instead, self-styled \"scientists\" have begun developing strict methodologies to ensure that the theories they posit can be tested and developed.\n\nIt is undeniable that this has led to some incredible advances, but although they CLAIM to be thoroughly tested, the fact is that many \"scientific\" discoveries seem to go against clerical teaching."

While this leads to high tariffs that can sometimes contribute to famine and goods shortages, it always ensured we had cash at hand.\nHowever, the new idea seems to be that mercantilism often worsens economic downturns, and reduces the value of our national goods in the long term.

Radicals are singing their beliefs in the streets, and state soldiers are viewed with distrust. There hasn't been an open revolt yet, but so many philosophers seem to be trying to instigate exactly that.\nTheir aim is to replace our well-functioning institutions with inefficient liberal bastardizations. It should not be this way, but the thinkers of our country seem to have declared their own ideological war against the state."

In 1520, King Christian went as far as to lead a military intervention in Sweden. Successful in his endeavour, Christian was anointed and swore the traditional oath to only appoint natural-born Swedes to the governing of the country. A great banquet was held in Stockholm in his honour, lasting several days. Then, on the 7th of November, the massacre began.\nThe king summoned many prominent Swedish officials and politicians to a private conference in the castle. Once there they were well received, but the king's hospitality only went so far. Soon Danish soldiers arrived with torches and axes and took them capture. Over the following day, more than 80 nobles, clergymen and politicians would be executed under the pretence of heresy.\n\nWhile intended to bring Sweden to its knees before Denmark, the executions had the opposite effect, and was the event that sparked the Swedish War of Liberation that permanently ended the union."

 hee_DAN.3.d:1 "Born in 1494, Tausen became a priest on the eve of the Lutheran Reformation. He went to Wittenberg in 1523, and was convinced by Lutheran principles. Upon his return to Denmark he started preaching the Lutheran faith, and he found many listening ears. He left the official church and made a practise of preaching from the church tower in Viborg. When he was denied the right to preach in the church, his followers broke in and forced a compromise where catholic priests would preach in the morning, and Tausen in the afternoon. The bishop has found this unacceptable, so he sent armed men to imprison the rogue priest. That hasn't helped, however, as large crowds now gather outside the window of his cell to hear him preach!\n\nIn time Hans Tausen would go on to become the foremost theologian of the Danish Reformation, but for now we must decide what to do with this heretic!"

 hee_DAN.4.d:1 "Hans Tausen was a priest convinced by Lutheran ideas, who had become noticed for preaching in the church of Viborg before the country's official conversion. He was imprisoned, but King Frederick I saw an opportunity. Interested in Lutheran ideas himself, particularly the ones about rulers receiving the church's property, he placed Tausen under his protection and named him court chaplain. As the Danish Reformation continued to spread, Tausen was called to preach in Copenhagen. The protestants became more and more confrontational against the catholic priests, and once King Fredrik died and Tausen was tried for heresy, a mob rose to attack the bishop of Copenhagen, ensuring Tausen's safety, who in turn protected the bishop from murder by mob.\nOnce Denmark officially converted to Lutheranism, Tausen was appointed bishop of Ribe. During his twenty years in that position, he continued to direct much of the still developing protestant faith in Denmark."

While initially disliked at court, he rose in power and used his influence to become the de facto regent of Denmark in 1771, when the king became too ill to govern at all.\n\nWhile in power, he attempted to institute extensive liberal reforms, issuing more than three cabinet orders a day. While his reforms were initially well-received, they soon became unpopular as they seemed to go against Danish values and traditions for the sake of abstract concepts of liberty. Struensee also had a relationship with the queen - herself a scandalous figure - who bore an illegitimate daughter. After just thirteen months of rule, Struensee was deposed and executed, and almost all of his reforms abolished."

However, in 1478 Queen Isabella I of Castile and King Ferdinand II of Aragon received permission from the Pope to establish the national Tribunal of the Holy Office of the Inquisition to replace the papal Inquisition of the middle ages.\n\nOne of the first officers of the Spanish Inquisition was Pedro de Arbués, who relentlessly pursued heretics and \"conversos,\" Jews who had received baptism, but who were often suspected of still practising Judaism. In 1484, his efforts earned him the position as the Inquisitor Provincial of the Kingdom of Aragon.\n\nIn Aragon the Inquisition immediately became unpopular, as it was seen as an attack on the provinces' autonomy. Combined with Arbués' pursuit of influential converso families, he quickly attracted notoriety, and on the 14 September 1485, he was attacked while attending mass.\nThe presence of conversos among the assailants sparked a movement against Jews, which saw more than twenty executions."

Servet was arrested by the reformists however, and in an attempt to prove the orthodoxy of his movement, Calvin pushed to have him executed before Servet's Catholic pursuers could catch up to him.\n\nWithout this unfortunate end, Miguel Servet might have been the source of a reform movement of his own."

Over the course of the sixteenth and seventeenth century, so-called \"Barbary Corsairs\" were one of the greatest threats to Christian ships in the Mediterranean, and their dreadful raids prevented most settlement along the coast of Spain and Southern Italy.\n\nDistant naval expeditions are challenging however, and impossible without a port to call home. We have been approached by a group of pirates who wish to enter into a privateer contract with us, and use one of our ports as their base of operations.\nIn addition to harassing the coastal settlements of the infidels of Europe, they promise they will be bringing a wealth of taken goods and slaves through our lands."
 hee_barbary.1.a:1 "Of course our ports are open to them!"
 hee_barbary.1.tt:1 "This will bring many opportunities, and much terror to the Christians of the Mediterranean."
 hee_barbary.1.b:1 "It is better to trade with the Christians than rob them."
 hee_barbary.2.t:1 "Sponsor Barbary Raid"
 hee_barbary.2.d:1 "The Barbary Corsairs operating out of our ports are planning a major expedition against a coastal town in Europe. Their preparations seem to be more for a military expedition than a piratical raid, but they swear they will be bringing back as much loot and as many slaves as their ships can bear.\nOf course, their captain assures us, they could bring much more if the king were to assist with a few more ships..."
 hee_barbary.2.a:1 "Of course we will sponsor this attack on the Christians!"
 hee_barbary.2.b:1 "We will use our naval strength to dominate the Mediterranean in other ways."
 hee_barbary.3.t:1 "$PROVINCE$ Raided by Barbary Corsairs"
 hee_barbary.3.d:1 "They came without warning on the northern wind. In the early morning, pirates flying the flag of one of the North African emirates descended on a town in $PROVINCE$. Now there is nothing left but burning ruins and refugees that escaped slavery."
 hee_barbary.3.a:1 "Cruel monsters!"
 hee_barbary.3.b:1 "We must do everything we can to help the town rebuild."
 hee_barbary.4.t:1 "Barbary Raid on $PROVINCE$ Repelled!"
 hee_barbary.4.d:1 "They came early in the morning with the northern wind, to pillage and enslave, but we had warning. A fisherman had spotted their ships off the coast a few days before, and troops were sent to every town nearby. Once the Barbary Corsairs landed, our brave soldiers engaged the infidels in fierce battle. They hadn't expected such resistance, and soon fell back to their ships. Our troops managed to set fire to one of their vessels, but the rest fled back to the North African emirate whose flags they flew.\nThey might return one day, but for now $PROVINCE$ is safe."
 hee_barbary.4.a:1 "[Root.GetName] remains ever vigilant."
 hee_barbary.5.t:1 "Raid Returns With Spoils"
 hee_barbary.5.d:1 "Our support of the Corsairs has paid dividends. As their ships anchored in the harbour, it became clear just how heavily loaded they were. Carts of stolen silver, wheat for weeks, and column after column of valuable slaves were brought ashore.\nNot only is it our right to tax all this, the monarch is entitled to a significant share for his support."
 hee_barbary.5.a:1 "Blessings upon us!"
 hee_barbary.6.t:1 "Raid Returns in Failure"
 hee_barbary.6.d:1 "Unthinkable. Not only did the expedition fail to loot and capture the town they settled on, several of their ships were lost in the attack! The Christians must have known the corsairs were coming, or just been exceedingly lucky, but that doesn't change the fact that this expedition has cost us dearly."
 hee_barbary.6.a:1 "How could this happen to us?"
 hee_barbary.7.t:1 "Retaliation for Corsair Attacks"
 hee_barbary.7.d:1 "The attacks from Barbary Corsairs are getting fiercer and more frequent, and there is no doubt who is letting them - nay, encouraging them to continue. Our people will not feel safe until the threat is dealt with.\nIt is time to act."
 hee_barbary.7.a:1 "They raid our coast, we bombard theirs."
 hee_barbary.7.b:1 "This has gone on long enough. We need to truly make them pay."
 hee_barbary.7.c:1 "They are across the coast. There is nothing we can do."
 hee_barbary.8.t:1 "\"Retaliation\" for Barbary Raids"
 hee_barbary.8.d:1 "Disaster has struck. A Christian contingent landed on our shores to slaughter innocent citizens. They are claiming it is revenge for similar attacks on their towns and cities, and have the temerity to accuse us of piracy, as if we are lowly thieves!"
 hee_barbary.8.a:1 "Such insults will not stand!"
 hee_barbary.8.b:1 "We must seek reconciliation, for the good of all."
 hee_barbary.9.t:1 "Barbary Corsairs Plaguing Trade Route"
 hee_barbary.9.d:1 "Barbary Corsairs, pirates supported by the Ottoman Empire and the emirates of North Africa, have long been a severe threat in the Mediterranean, both for ships and coastal settlements, which they raid for plunder and slaves.\nNow they have started moving in on what we have long considered our safest trade route, and with a ship going missing seemingly every other day, our merchants are suffering."
 hee_barbary.9.a:1 "We must increase patrols and keep them at bay."
 hee_barbary.9.b:1 "That's just the risk of travel at sea."
 hee_barbary.10.t:1 "Decline of the Barbary Corsairs"
 hee_barbary.10.d:1 "Barbary pirates would continue to harass ships in the Mediterranean long into the nineteenth century. However, towards the end of the seventeenth century, European ships started being equipped with more advanced weaponry, making raiding ships challenging, and ensuring greater safety on most trade routes used by the Christians. This meant that while still something to be wary of, barbary corsairs were no longer the horror of the sea they had once been."
 hee_barbary.10.a:1 "One golden age has ended. May another begin."
 hee_swabian_events.1.t:1 "Establish a Swabian League"
 hee_swabian_events.1.d:1 "In 1488, the imperial princes and Free Cities of the stem duchy of Swabia formed a defensive pact to counter the growing threat of the Bavarian Dukes and the Swiss Confederacy. This was the Swabian League, a mutual agreement of support in the case of enemy aggression. Its purpose was to bring stability to the region, but it also became one of the emperor's most important military forces in South Germany. The League achieved its goal, and with Switzerland and Bavaria pacified, it grew weaker over time. In 1534, after years of infighting because of the Lutheran Reformation, the League was finally disbanded."

This was the Swabian League, a mutual agreement of support in the case of enemy aggression. The League achieved its goal, but with no new enemies, it grew weaker over time. In 1534, after years of infighting because of the Lutheran Reformation, the League was finally disbanded. [From.GetName] has called on us to be a founding member in just such a League!

 hee_swabian_events.4.b:1 "They only seek to bind us because they fear us!"
 hee_swabian_events.5.t:1 "A New Member of the League"
 hee_swabian_events.5.d:1 "With the success of the League's diplomats, another ruler has chosen to swear themselves to our banners. Together with [From.GetName], Swabia stands stronger than ever."

 hee_swabian_events.6.d:1 "At the most recent diet of the League, the other princes turned [From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] of [From.GetName] away at the door. [From.Monarch.GetHerHis] acts of aggression have earned the [From.Monarch.GetTitle] this, and the rejection is tantamount to the banishment of [Root.GetName] from the League."

Nevertheless we have been banished from all meetings of the League! We are better off without their scheming politics."
 hee_swabian_events.7.a:1 "How dare they!"
 hee_swabian_events.8.t:1 "Disbanding the League"
 hee_swabian_events.8.d:1 "With the fading relevance of the League, its power to act is dissipating, and every League diet is smaller than the last. At present, the League can barely muster an army to match the regional powers surrounding it. The time has finally come to acknowledge its fall."
 hee_swabian_events.8.a:1 "Swabia is once again divided."
 hee_swabian_events.9.t:1 "The Swabian League Disbands!"
 hee_swabian_events.9.d:1 "The League is no longer a power of any influence or might. It is nothing but an abandoned dream, soon forgotten. This diet, with barely any princes in attendance, is its last."
 hee_swabian_events.9.a:1 "We will find other allies. It is time to move on."
 hee_swabian_events.10.t:1 "Religious Infighting Brings the League to Its Knees"
 hee_swabian_events.10.d:1 "After years of religious conflict, the Swabian League is unable to muster its forces, or even gather civilly in a diet. In the end, the Reformation has torn Swabia asunder, leaving each prince to once again fend for themselves."
 hee_swabian_events.10.a:1 "There is nothing to be done."
 hee_swabian_events.11.t:1 "The Swabian League Disbands!"
 hee_swabian_events.11.d:1 "Due to the religious conflicts plaguing the land, the League is nothing but a shell of its former self. No two princes can agree on anything, and war is as likely to be called within as without. It will never form a united front again."

 hee_WBG.1.d:1 "The University of Wurzburg had originally been founded in 1402 as one of the earliest universities in Germany. However, due to lack of financial security and the lack of discipline among the student body led to the university closing down. Indeed, in addition to gambling, drinking and general chaos, the first chancellor of the school was stabbed by a scholar's assistant.\n\nIn 1545, Prince Bishop Julius Echter von Mespelbrunn deemed it prudent to reopen the university through a new founding, letting the school reestablish itself with a new charter guaranteeing its existence as an independent body. In its first centuries it served as a \"bastion of Catholicism in the face of Lutheranism\" as stated by its charter, but eventually non-Catholics would be allowed to study there. Despite the centuries filled with political chaos that would follow for Wurzburg, the second founding lasted, and the University of Wurzburg is a respected academic institution to this day."

 hee_VEN.1.t:1 "Il Ridotto"
 hee_VEN.1.d:1 "As the original European casino, Il Ridotto was a government-owned gambling house that formalised gambling and excessive money loss in Venice in 1638. It was established once the Great Council gave up on preventing people from playing for money during the Carnivale. Eventually, people from across Europe would come to Venice to test their luck, and hopefully make a quick fortune. While the wing of the San Moisè Palace was supposedly open to the public, only nobles could afford the high stakes played with there.\n\nWhile money flowed freely for more than a century, gambling was outlawed and Il Ridotto was closed in 1774."

 hee_TUS.1.t:1 "The Thornton Expedition"
 hee_TUS.1.d:1 "In 1608, Captain Robert Thornton was commissioned by Ferdinando de Medici to prepare for the establishment of a Tuscan settlement in South America.\nThornton was successful in his journey, and following exploration of the Amazon and the Orinoco he planned for the colony to be established in what is today French Guyana.\n\nWith a perfect place found, and without losing a single man on the expedition, Thornton returned to Tuscany. However, Ferdinando had died, and his successor was uninterested in continuing the colonisation project of his predecessor. Despite the testimony of both Thornton and a native he had brought back that there were many riches and much commerce to be found, no one could be convinced to pursue the scheme of a colony.\nThis saw the end of the only attempt by an Italian state to colonise the New World."

 hee_TUS.2.d:1 "In the late sixteenth century, Cosimo de Medici, first Grand Duke of Tuscany introduced laws that would allow his citizens great freedoms in the practise of their religion. Thanks to his good relations with the Pope, Cosimo was able to ban the clergy from holding administrative positions, and allow people to choose their own method of worship.\nNearly eight decades before the Peace of Westphalia these laws were unprecedented in Europe, and especially in a catholic princedom. Nevertheless, it led to Tuscany becoming an early destination for religious migrants, aiding the Grand Duchy's prosperity."

 hee_TUS.6.d:1 "Tuscany under the $DYNASTY$s were long a financial powerhouse. However, thanks to banking and ownership of much of the local industry, the ruler exerted so much control over the duchy's economy that the distinction between personal and state funds was largely negligible.\nFor example did the Grand Duke have exclusive rights to the state's extraction of salt and minerals, but at the same time those funds were expected to also benefit the state. However, with so much personal control, what was state money and what was family money largely came down to the personality of the Grand Duke at the time."

It had the motto \"Try and try again,\" and published \"the Saggi,\" a book that became the standard laboratory manual of the eighteenth century (\"'Saggi di naturali esperienze fatte nell'Accademia del Cimento sotto la protezione del Serenissimo Principe Leopoldo di Toscan e descritte dal segretario di essa Accademia\")."

Jews were banned from having intercourse with Christians, and Christians were not allowed to work in establishments owned by Jews. Eventually Jews were forbidden from living with Christians as well, along with being forbidden from visiting Christian prostitutes (no doubt to protect their Christian virtue).Being a Puritan, Cosimo's legal reforms affected Christian life significantly as well, banning May celebrations and beheading sodomites.\n\nIn his defence, he desperately needed the money he got from fining crimes that did not result in swift execution."

 hee_TUS.10.d:1 "Peter Leopold of the house Habsburg-Lorraine, who ruled Tuscany between 1765 and 1790, was unpopular for an unusual reason. He introduced extensive social, legal and financial reforms in Tuscany, but met extensive opposition from all strata of society, as the reforms were considered too liberal.\n\nReforming the tax system to ease the burden on citizens, and conducting profitable public works were well received, but his attempts at reducing the power of the clergy was stopped by opposition from the Pope and his political allies. He did achieve many things, however, especially in guaranteeing legal rights for citizens, as well as through legislation and development of hospitals vastly improving the treatment of the mentally ill. This took place through the \"legge sui pazzi,\" the law of the insane, which was the first of its kind in Europe.\n\nA system for inoculation against smallpox was set up as an early predecessor of vaccination programs, and an early institution for the rehabilitation of juvenile delinquents was founded. Peter Leopold also approved and attempted to introduce a constitution in Tuscany, which would see greater rights given to its citizens, and ensure a balance between legislative and executive powers.\n\nThe constitution met fierce resistance, even from those who would benefit from it, and was never put into effect, as Leopold in 1790 moved to Vienna upon his ascension to the throne of the Holy Roman Empire."

 hee_TUR.10.d:1 "Murad II had ruled the Ottoman Empire for more than twenty years, facing insurrection and disloyalty while continuing the Empire's expansion, before retiring in favour of his son Mehmet in late 1444.\n\nThe transition was unclear however, as the 12-year old Mehmet made famous when calling his father to lead the Turkish armies at the battle of Varna: \"If you are the Sultan, come and lead your armies. If I am the Sultan, I command you to come and lead my armies.\" Murad led the armies and won a great victory over the Christian coalition on 10 November 1444, ending the Crusade of Varna.\n\nMurad was not free to return to retirement, however. While the young Sultan attempted to establish his authority, Çandarli Halil Pasha, grand vizier and true governor of the empire, opposed him. The grand vizier found Mehmed too strongly influenced by his teacher, who Çandarli considered a rival.\n\nÇandarli arranged for dissent among the Janissaries, who threatened with revolt unless Murad were to return to the throne. Still mostly a child, Mehmet acquiesced and Murad returned to once again rule the empire.\n\nHe passed away five years later, and Mehmet could once again take the throne, this time unopposed. Two days after Mehmet's greatest achievement, the conquest of Constantinople in 1453, the Sultan had Çandarli put to death."

 hee_SWI.1.d:1 "In the late middle ages, Swiss mercenaries became a common sight on the battlefields of Europe. This was in no small part thanks to the fact that the Swiss cantons organised and trained regiments that could be bought into service in other parts of Europe.\n\nThe Swiss became known as some of the deadliest soldiers in Europe, as they were trained to work together to perform devastating mass attacks as a single unit.\n\nEventually, after two centuries of being the finest soldiers on the battlefields of Europe, Swiss mercenaries would find their match in the widespread use of firearms."

Gradually the strategic conflict became one of religion, and the entirety of Gräubunden got involved on one side or the other.\n\nThe valley changed allegiance multiple times, before settling in the hands of the leagues of Gräubunden in exchange for a guarantee of free exercise of the catholic faith."

While issuing grand construction projects and modernising the country, part of the reason for his success was his firm rule and ruthlessness. Where previous viceroys had failed to exert control over the kingdom, \"Don Pedro\" closed down humanist institutions and instituted harsh penalties for petty crimes. He centralised national institutions, and moved every court to the Castel Capuano. By breaking up traditional land holdings, barons were forced to move to the city where they would be within reach of de Toledo's government.\n\nHe failed in introducing the Spanish Inquisition in Naples, however, as revolts forced the Spanish king to retract the order. De Toledo passed away shortly after, in 1552, while on state business in Siena, ensuring that his legacy of state building would forever outshine the harshness of his rule."

 hee_SAX.5.d:1 "Crypto-Calvinism was the influence of Calvinism within the Lutheran Church, and was considered a serious threat to the new church following the death of Martin Luther.\nIn Saxony, Calvinist principles were fairly common among prominent figures as a result of the powerful Philippist party's secret promotion of Calvinism in the electorate. (Philippist after Philipp Melanchton, Luther's closest ally.)\nWhile Crypto-Calvinists seized power in the Saxon church during the rule of Elector Augustus, but gradually works that were undeniably Calvinist in nature came to light.

This tradition held so strong that even Saxon electors who converted to Catholicism were allowed to lead the gatherings, provided the privy council was given charge of all matters religious in Saxony, and only admitted Lutherans."

 hee_SAX.7.d:1 "In 1697 the Elector Augustus II von Wettin converted from Lutheranism to Catholicism. This was largely due to his ascension to the throne of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, as the Polish king was required to be Catholic.\nAs the Dukes of Saxony were renowned as champions of the reformation, Saxony remained the leader of the Corpus Evangelicorum, the imperial board of the Lutheran estates, but now with the Catholic Augustus at its head. Augustus guaranteed Saxon Lutheranism however, and followed orthodox Lutheran doctrine in his dealings with other Lutheran states. However, to guarantee future von Wettins for the throne of Poland meant that every possible successor had to convert to Catholicism, including the future elector Augustus III. Upon this the Estates of Saxony began protesting, threatening revolt in defence of the Lutheran faith. Augustus II therefore transferred all religious control in Saxony to the Electoral privy council, as suggested by the Corpus Evangelicorum. The privy council also established that only a Lutheran might partake, which meant that Lutheranism in Saxony was safeguarded, and disaster averted."

The tall, bell-shaped dome would come to define any view of Dresden for the following two centuries.\n\nHowever, the Catholic elector Augustus III felt that Dresden needed religious balance, and therefore in 1738 initiated the construction of the Katholische Hofkirche (which would later become Dresden Cathedral).

While she lived in Saxony, she often accompanied her husband to Poland, even several times after he became embroiled in the War of the Polish Succession. She learnt to speak Polish, and was often present for assemblies of the Polish parliament.\nAs a strong political figure, she practically governed Saxony during Frederick Augustus' absence, though she was never officially named regent. She was a dedicated Catholic, even being chided by her confessor for being more religious than behoved a person outside a monastic order. Nevertheless she preached tolerance, and gave alms as much to poor Lutherans as poor Catholics.\nAs a former heiress presumptive of the imperial throne, she became an active player in the War of the Austrian Succession, before ceding her claim in favour of an alliance with Austria. Her politicking continued her entire life by influencing the power balance between Saxony and Poland as well as between her sons, the heirs to the thrones. During the Seven Years War, she was placed under house arrest by the Prussians, but kept on communicating with the outside world through the use of Prussian connections and letters written in invisible ink."

 hee_SAX.10.d:1 "Before the reformation, Martin Luther was a theological scholar at the university of Wittenberg, and his writings were academic in nature. While certainly critical of aspects of the church, they were meant as texts that searched for new answers within old doctrines, rather than presenting new doctrines of their own. It was largely through papal and imperial reaction to the Lutheran texts that they became directives of faith that sparked Luther's reformational work.\n\nNow one of these texts has been discovered before reaching wide circulation, and it does have some deeply incisive comments about papal practises. What is to be done with it?"

 hee_SAX.11.t:1 "Nikolaus Krell"
 hee_SAX.11.d:1 "Nikolaus Krell was the chancellor of the elector of Saxony from 1589 to 1591, a position he used to further his Calvinist beliefs at the cost of Saxony's Lutheran traditions. As an influential and capable politician, he ensured Calvinists were appointed to high offices, especially in the church, and he had a translation of the bible with Calvinist annotations published and disseminated.\nIn the end, distrust of his faith and jealousy at his position and influence with the elector meant that when Elector Christian died in 1591, rivals in the nobility ensured that he was arrested. He remained imprisoned for ten years, six of them in trial at the Reichskammergericht, before being sentenced to death for Crypto-Calvinism.\nHe was decapitated in Dresden, and a paving stone with the letters \"Kr\" still marks the exact place of his death."

The duchy's involvement in foreign wars and conflicts far beyond its own borders made the mercenary armies of old difficult to maintain for longer campaigns. Instead, a general army was created, a standing force that would only ever answer to the Duke of Savoy, and continually train and develop between wars, rather than be disbanded. This was how Savoy established one of Europe's first standing armies, helping the country survive the multitude of conflicts it was involved in."

The title was a formality, however, as the entirety of Savoy was under French occupation at the time. Instead he served the Habsburgs of Spain, as a soldier, and later as governor of the Netherlands. That was how he came to lead the Spanish invasion of northern France, where he took revenge for his lost duchy by winning a great victory. The following peace treaty restored some of Savoy to Emmanuel Philibert, who spent the next twenty years using the conflicts between France and Spain to gradually regain territory from both countries. It is thanks to his victories on the battlefield he is remembered as \"Testa di ferro\", Ironhead, but he also worked hard to internally rebuild the state apparatus that had been lost in the French conquest."

He aimed to expand Savoyard territory, and often started wars he struggled to finish. Regularly switching allegiance between France and Spain, he ended up having to cede more land than he gained, and he famously failed to take Genoa in a humiliating defeat that is still celebrated in that city to this day. Nevertheless, with consideration for the fact that he helped Savoy survive in what seemed an impossibly precarious situation - forming the border between French and Spanish interests in Italy - Firehead is remembered as \"the Great\", a testament to the fact that his rashness and overconfidence was exactly what Savoy needed at the time."
