 republic.001.t:1 "The Republic of $COUNTRY$"
 republic.001.d:1 "During the Renaissance, most countries had patchworks of laws and regulations rather than a single uniform code. This was especially true of republics, which, at least in theory, worked on the principle of representation of their populations, and which used trading privileges and voting rights to sway colonies and conquered cities to their side. A $MONARCHTITLE$ who granted rights and privileges to his people might be weaker than a king, but he could win the loyalty of the people more easily."
 republic.001.a:1 "I understand."
 republic.002.t:1 "The Charter of $PROVINCECAPITAL$"
 republic.002.d:1 "Now that we have added $PROVINCENAME$ to the republic, we must decide how to treat it. If we grant it the same rights and privileges our people have become accustomed to, we may win their hearts and minds - to say nothing of their support in the next election! On the other hand, if we rule over them with an iron fist, it will give the $MONARCHTITLE$ more personal power, but at the cost of alienating republican supporters in $COUNTRY$."
 republic.002.a:1 "Promise them complete autonomy."
 republic.002.b:1 "Promise them great autonomy."
 republic.002.c:1 "Promise them some autonomy."
 republic.002.e:1 "Grant them limited autonomy."
 republic.002.f:1 "Crush the local government and rule them from $CAPITAL_CITY$!"

 desc_moderate_autonomy:1 "This city has been granted extensive rights and privileges, which sometimes results in conflict between it and the national government."

 desc_low_autonomy:1 "This city has been granted certain rights and privileges in order to keep it happy."
 remove_autonomy_total_title:1 "Revoke Autonomy"
 remove_autonomy_total_desc:1 "Once granted, it was difficult to withdraw rights from a city. The people quickly became accustomed to their autonomy and would fight to keep them - in parliament, or when that failed, by force of arms. However, a ruler who wanted to centralise the state paid little heed to such complaints."

 republic.003.t:1 "$PROVINCECAPITAL$ Demands Rights"
 republic.003.d:1 "The city of $PROVINCECAPITAL$ is arguing that its wealth and influence in $COUNTRY$ entitles it to a degree of autonomy that it is not currently receiving from us. A delegation of its leading citizens have arrived in $CAPITAL_CITY$ to argue their case. It is clear that they will regard the $MONARCHTITLE$ as a tyrant if he refuses to agree to some autonomy, but at the same time, they are not talking about open revolt... yet."
 republic.003.a:1 "Refuse to give in to their demands."
 republic.003.b:1 "Grant them a new charter."
 republic_to_monarchy:1 "Coup d'Etat"
 desc_republic_to_monarchy:1 "A republic allowed talented, ambitious schemers to rise to the top - but not to pass it on to their children.  Our ruler is talented, ambitious, popular - and unhappy with this limitation.  By gaining popularity, crushing opposition and amassing a personal army, a canny politician could transform the office of $MONARCHTITLE$ into a hereditary monarchy."
 republic_to_monarchy.1.t:1 "$MONARCH$'s Ambitions"
 republic_to_monarchy.1.d:1 "$MONARCH$ was a popular, talented politician - and an ambitious one.  Being $MONARCHTITLE$ of a republic meant accepting limitations that a monarch did not face - and so an ambitious $MONARCHTITLE$ might try to seize power and transform the office into a hereditary monarchy.  This flew in the face of the republican traditions of $COUNTRY$, and would anger many.  It would mean rewriting laws, exiling rivals, and solidifying control of the armed forces - and one misstep could result in exile."
 republic_to_monarchy.1.a:1 "Seize control of the reins of power"
 republic_to_monarchy.1.b:1 "Force the $MONARCHTITLE$ to resign"

 republic_to_monarchy.3.t:1 "Rival House leads rebellion" #MIL
 republic_to_monarchy.3.d:1 "In the chaos, there is an opportunity.  One of our rivals at court has decided to take advantage of the power struggle in $CAPITAL_CITY$ by raising his banner against us - not to defend the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Republic, but simply for his own advantage.  Let us hope this does not tear apart the Republic..."
 republic_to_monarchy.3.a:1 "Fight the traitors"
 republic_to_monarchy.3.b:1 "Have the entire family arrested"
 republic_to_monarchy.4.t:1 "$MONARCHTITLE$'s Authority Challenged" #ADM
 republic_to_monarchy.4.d:1 "The legal system of $COUNTRY$ was a mixture of long-standing traditions, ancient laws and more modern statutes.  With so much complexity, it was possible for the $MONARCHTITLE$ to find loopholes that allowed [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] to consolidate power for [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] completely legally.  Yet doing it legally did not mean there would be no opposition!  $MONARCH$'s opponents at court have now amassed their lawyers and begun a legal challenge to the $MONARCHTITLE$'s authority that could lead to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] downfall."
 republic_to_monarchy.4.a:1 "Order them all arrested"

 republic_to_monarchy.5.d:1 "As $MONARCH$ continues [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] campaign to seize power in $CAPITAL_CITY$, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] enemies have begun to wake up to the fact that this is no ordinary jockeying for position.  Now a senator from a distinguished family with a long career in the military has openly denounced the $MONARCHTITLE$ and declared himself to be the 'defender of republican values'.  If we do not act quickly, this could lead to all-out civil war!"
 republic_to_monarchy.5.a:1 "Declare him a rebel and a traitor"
 republic_to_monarchy.5.b:1 "Declare myself to be the true defender of the republic"
 republic_to_monarchy.6.t:1 "Rewriting the Laws" #ADM
 republic_to_monarchy.6.d:1 "Although $COUNTRY_ADJ$ laws had many loopholes, they were designed with a republic in mind.  There was no way to get around the fact that, eventually, $MONARCH$ would have to step down.  No way within the current laws, that is.  If the Senate could be persuaded to agree, the $MONARCHTITLE$ could be given emergency powers that allowed [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] to rewrite the laws.  Yet the Senate would hardly agree unless they were coerced somehow..."

 republic_to_monarchy.7.d:1 "Although the $MONARCHTITLE$ was careful and circumspect, it was becoming obvious what [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] was after.  [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] had amassed many rivals in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] term, and now those rivals were uniting against [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] at court, frustrating [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] plans."
 republic_to_monarchy.7.a:1 "Exile the ringleaders"
 republic_to_monarchy.7.b:1 "Divide them against each other"
 republic_to_monarchy.8.t:1 "Control of the Army" #MIL
 republic_to_monarchy.8.d:1 "If $MONARCH$ was to proclaim [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] '$MONARCHTITLE$-for-life', [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] needed the support of the military.  Yet most of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ military was led by $PRIMARY_CULTURE$ officers who supported the Republic.  Only a few were personally loyal to $MONARCH$."
 republic_to_monarchy.8.a:1 "Form a personal militia while reducing the power of the army"
 republic_to_monarchy.8.b:1 "Promise the officers nobility under the new regime"
 republic_to_monarchy.9.t:1 "The Great Council" #DIP
 republic_to_monarchy.9.d:1 "In their wisdom, the founders of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Republic attempted to limit the power of the $MONARCHTITLE$ by placing the appointment of officials in the hands of a group of citizens known as the Great Council.  Elected for one-year terms and barred from seeking re-election, it made suborning them both expensive and futile.  It would have to go if $MONARCH$ was to hold real power...yet the council was immensely popular with the common man, who saw it as egalitarian (even if most of its members were aristocrats)."
 republic_to_monarchy.9.a:1 "Bribe council members into resigning"

 republic_to_monarchy.10.t:1 "Uncooperative Senator" #DIP
 republic_to_monarchy.10.d:1 "Although it has little actual power, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Senate is proving to be a problem for the $MONARCHTITLE$.  It is led by an elderly man who frequently rails against the 'abuses of democracy' and 'corruption at the top' that he sees.  Although he can do little to actually stop the coup from succeeding, his tirades are attracting unnecessary attention."
 republic_to_monarchy.10.a:1 "Exile him from $COUNTRY$"

 republic_to_monarchy.11.t:1 "The $MONARCHTITLE$'s counsellors" #ADM
 republic_to_monarchy.11.d:1 "Knowing that a strong $MONARCHTITLE$ would be tempted to transform the government into a monarchy, the founders of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Republic created the role of Counsellor - an elected position that acted as a magistrate, an advisor, and a check upon [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] power.  Their relationship with the $MONARCHTITLE$ was not always adversarial, but it was impossible to forget that their purpose was to prevent $MONARCH$ from realising [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] ambitions."
 republic_to_monarchy.11.a:1 "Hire an assassin to get rid of them"
 republic_to_monarchy.11.b:1 "What could be better than having them join the conspiracy?"
 republic_to_monarchy.12.t:1 "The [From.GetAdjective] Republic"
 republic_to_monarchy.12.d:1 "Refugees have arrived from [From.GetName] seeking an audience with the $MONARCHTITLE$.  It seems that they were forced out by the [From.Monarch.GetTitle] of [From.GetName] in a coup d'etat - a base attempt to seize power and declare [From.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] a monarch!\n\nNow our guests are begging us to invade their homeland, oust the usurper and restore the [From.GetAdjective] Republic."
 republic_to_monarchy.12.a:1 "We shall consider it"
 republican_monarch_victory:1 "After long months of preparation, the plan was complete.  With the support of key figures in the army, soldiers quietly occupied the parliament, the armoury, and other strategic locations in the capital.  Meanwhile, generals loyal to the new regime took control of regiments whose loyalty was in doubt, and members of the Senate were rounded up and arrested.  By the time the sun had risen, citizens of the republic woke to find posters proclaiming the new regime."
 republican_monarch_defeat:1 "The Republic had withstood a challenge to its democratic traditions.  Thanks to the efforts of its defenders, it had resisted efforts to rewrite the laws and establish a monarchy in its place.  As the regime collapsed, an election was declared and the people celebrated in the streets.  All was well once more...yet could the Republic truly survive another such attempt?"
 republican_monarch_neutral:1 "The struggle had weakened both Republicans and Monarchists, leaving them vulnerable to a surprising challenge from the priests.  With the recent power struggle out in the open, the average citizen was disgusted by both alternatives and ready to leap into the arms of Mother Church.  The nation, it seemed, had much to atone for.  It was the beginning of a new chapter in its history."

 plot_to_become_monarchy_desc:1 "The leader of a republic had limits, but a king was unquestioned.  A popular and talented leader could perhaps find a way to transform a political office into a royal title.  The process would be dangerous, for many would oppose the change, and it would destroy the republican traditions of the nation.\n\nIn order to start the process of becoming a monarchy, we must start the 'Seizing Power' disaster.  As our republican tradition goes down, it would be a good idea to amass gold, troops and monarch points for the coming crisis."

 desc_plot_to_become_monarchy:1 "Our leader is plotting a way to seize total power - appointing favourites to key positions, whispering in the ears of potential allies, finding ways of getting rid of rivals.  While much of this is business as usual, its cumulative effect is to eat away at the democratic traditions of our nation."
