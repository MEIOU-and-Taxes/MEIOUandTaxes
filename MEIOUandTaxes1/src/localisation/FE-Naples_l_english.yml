 flavor_nap.101.t: "Death of Louis"
 flavor_nap.101.d: "Louis gained the crown of Naples by marrying his first cousin, Queen Joanna I, whose prior husband, Andrew, had died as a result of a conspiracy that may have involved both of them. Immediately after securing his status as her co-ruler, Louis successfully wrested away all power from his wife, leaving her a sovereign in name only. Their disastrous marriage resulted in the birth of two daughters, Catherine and Frances, neither of whom survived their parents. Louis died, probably of bubonic plague, in Naples on 26 May 1362. Joanna immediately resumed authority in her realms."
