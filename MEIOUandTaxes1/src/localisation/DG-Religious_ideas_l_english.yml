 charitable_work:1 "Charitable work"

 missionary_work:1 "Missionary work"
 missionary_work_desc:1 "Devout individuals have always been called to spread the good word of our faith to others who are not as fortunate as to know the truth yet.  Organising this process by creating schools and encouraging youths to spend time as missionaries will have a dramatic effect on our proselytism efforts."
 religious_settlements:1 "Religious Settlements"
 religious_settlements_desc:1 "Individuals called to serve the divine sometimes felt they needed to live in seclusion from society.  Some of them founded monasteries and other settlements in areas that were far from settled areas.  In the process, they built farms, homes and schools, and so encouraged peasants to move nearby.  In so doing, they opened up new areas to habitation, increasing the prosperity of the whole nation."
 monastic_diversity:1 "Monastic Diversity"
 monastic_diversity_desc:1 "By having a wide variety of religious orders, ascetics can choose to join an order that specialises in an area of interest to them.  Some choose to preach to unbelievers, others to produce wine and cheese, others to become teachers.  In so doing they manage to gather highly educated people together for the common good."
 interfaith_dialogue:1 "Interfaith Dialogue"
 interfaith_dialogue_desc:1 "Having had to deal with competing orders and sects in the past, our religious leaders have become adept at smoothing over theological differences rather than fighting over them.  In this manner, we avoid schism and heresy while allowing for differences."
 
 theology_ideas:1 "State Religion Ideas"
 theology_ideas_bonus:1 "Full State Religion"
 religious_traditions:1 "Religious Traditions"

 divine_right:1 "Divine Right"
 divine_right_desc:1 "Our ruler reigns through the grace of God.  Since the Almighty creates all things, it is only reasonable to assume that one born to the throne was destined to rule.  With this message spread from the pulpit, our ruler enjoys support from the faithful."

 mandatory_church_attendance:1 "Mandatory Church Attendance"
 mandatory_church_attendance_desc:1 "In a time before high-speed communication, the church was a powerful tool for rulers to spread messages to their people.

 ceremony_ideas_bonus:1 "Full Prophecy"

 augury:1 "Augury"
 augury_desc:1 "Our priests claim to be able to foretell the future in a variety of ways, from analysing scripture to reading omens.  The people rely on this to make plans - where to settle, when to fight a battle, even who to marry.  By having these signs to follow, the people are more content."
 monuments:1 "Monuments"
 monuments_desc:1 "Our faith is displayed not only by priests and temples, but also by sacred monuments built purely to celebrate our religion.  These serve as a constant reminder of the power and mystery of the divine."
 sacrifices:1 "Sacrifices"
 sacrifices_desc:1 "There is a common belief among the people that, when bad things happen to us, it is God's anger.  It stands to reason that by mollifying God, we can turn his anger away from us.  This takes the form of public sacrifices by priests and rulers.  The people, knowing that this will mollify God, go away in a cheerful mood from these events."
 grand_ceremony:1 "Grand Ceremony"
 grand_ceremony_desc:1 "There is a ceremony for everything, from marriage to funerals, from planting crops to declaring war.

 popular_religion_ideas_bonus:1 "Full Popular Religion"
 religious_art:1 "Religious Art"

 reliquaries:1 "Reliquaries"
 reliquaries_desc:1 "There is a widespread belief that objects owned by or part of a holy person remain holy after their death.

This also allows rulers to amass holy relics as part of their regalia."
 faith_healing:1 "Faith Healing"
 faith_healing_desc:1 "Priests are capable of calling upon God for blessings.  For some of the faithful, this can heal afflictions and bring balms to the suffering.  As a result, the people flock to such faith healers for all sorts of problems real and imagined."
 evangelism:1 "Evangelism"
 evangelism_desc:1 "Not only priests, but the laity reach out to unbelievers, seeking to convert their fellows to the one true faith.  While this does not always win them friends, it acts as a powerful army of missionaries!"
 flexible_theology:1 "Flexible Theology"

 itinerant_preachers:1 "Itinerant Preachers"

 ecceleistical_judiciary:1 "Ecclesiastical Judiciary"
 ecceleistical_judiciary_desc:1 "Having a highly literate clergy who are trained to practise a divine code of laws gives us a ready-made justice system that can replace the authority of local nobles with a single, unified set of laws for the entire nation.  While it can resist a ruler's authority, it helps to tip power away from the aristocracy and reduces arbitrary or evil misuses of justice."
 religious_advisors:1 "Religious Advisors"
 religious_advisors_desc:1 "Our secular leaders are advised by religious leaders in their pay.  By maintaining a position of responsibility at court, nobles effectively created a network of neutral communication between themselves and their neighbours.  When a crisis threatened war, court chaplains could act as neutral negotiators to defuse the situation."
 educated_priests:1 "Educated priests"
 educated_priests_desc:1 "As some of the most highly educated members of society who also had the chance to spend their lives in seclusion, priests had a nearly unique role in society.

Many of the discoveries of the early modern era were brought to light thanks to the efforts of dedicated priests."
 
 
 popular_religion:1 "Popular Religion"

 pure_land_of_the_west_desc:1 "Buddhists believed that in the current corrupt age, it was nearly impossible for someone to gain enlightenment.  However, Ikkô-shû Buddhism taught that by chanting to the Buddha Amida, followers would be transported to the Pure Land of the West upon their deaths, there to be granted enlightenment by him.  This meant that if they died while fighting for the cause, they would be all but guaranteed to reach paradise.  This doctrine attracted many willing to die for the sect."
 ikki_leagues:1 "Ikkis"
 ikki_leagues_desc:1 "With the breakdown of social order in Japan, peasants formed self-defence leagues called Ikki in which they publicly vowed to protect villages in front of the Buddha.  These Ikki were supported by the Ikkô-shû sect and later fought for them, providing them with thousands of at least partially trained infantry."
 fortified_temples:1 "Fortified temples"
 fortified_temples_desc:1 "The Ikkô-shû cooperated with local Ikki, fortifying local temples until they acted as forts that could provide the militia with protection and supply.  This made invading their territory a prolonged and difficult task."
 temple_towns:1 "Towns within temples"
 temple_towns_desc:1 "The Pure Land sect was popular with low-ranking samurai who were often willing to let the sect build temples on the small plots of land they were granted by their lieges.

The temples naturally controlled the new 'town within a temple' and the lucrative commercial districts that were within its walls."
 adoption_of_firearms:1 "Eager adoption of firearms"
 adoption_of_firearms_desc:1 "Realising that they could not directly compete with the samurai on their own terms, the Ikkô-Ikki were eager to adopt weapons that could level the playing field for unarmoured infantry: firearms.

 religious_monarchy:1 "Religious monarchy"
 religious_monarchy_desc:1 "Rulership of the Ikkô-shû sect was passed down from father to son.  This meant that the ruling dynasty was not only a powerful family, but also chosen by the Buddha."
 peasant_leadership:1 "Peasant leadership"
 peasant_leadership_desc:1 "Having alienated the ruling class of Japan, the Ikkô-Ikki was forced to rely entirely on the lower classes.  To the surprise of many, such peasants often rivalled educated aristocrats and samurai for their talent and drive."

 cataphracts:1 "Cataphracts"
 cataphracts_desc:1 "The inspiration for the medieval knight came from Roman wars against the Sassanids, who used Parthian Cataphracts as the backbone of their army.  Heavily armoured noblemen who could fight equally well with swords or with bows, they were a force to be feared - and a form that has largely disappeared from the battlefield.  Let us revive them!"
 immortals:1 "The Immortals"
 immortals_desc:1 "The Zhayedan were an elite unit within the cataphracts.  Given only the finest weaponry and armour and riding the famed Nisean horses, they fought with such ferocity and skill that their glittering coats of mail and gleaming cuirasses were said to break the enemy's morale simply by showing up to the battlefield."
 cyrus_cylinder:1 "The Cyrus Cylinder"
 cyrus_cylinder_desc:1 "The greatest legacy of the Persian empire is found in the Cyrus Cylinder, which proclaims a tolerance of all faiths.  In so doing, we can unite the many peoples of the Persian Empire into one!"
