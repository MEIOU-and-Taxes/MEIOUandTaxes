 shahfirozs_empire:1 "Twilight of Hindustan"
 desc_shahfirozs_empire:1 "The succession of Firoz to the throne was a time of turmoil, as Hindustan fell into disunity and chaos. Many governors have since declared independence or been overthrown by local rulers, with Bengal, Madurai and Bahmani becoming the most powerful Islamic states outside our domain. The Sultan holds what remains of Hindustan together, yet his rule is tainted by widespread corruption and general incompetence. If his successor is weak, or if corruption is not reigned in, the Sultanate may not last past his lifetime."
 India.01.t: "Bengali Restoration"
 India.01.desc: "The rich and bountiful plains of the east were lost to us in 1338, when the governors of Bengal betrayed the Sultanate and declared independence. Though the conqueror of Bengal has been brought to heel, subdued as a tributary in 1353, most of Bengal remains outside our dominion.\n\nThe Sultanate has lost vast swaths of land, yet we have an opportunity to reverse our fortunes. If we desire, we can break the truce we signed and launch a war of conquest against the traitors of Bengal. Our advisors fear that if we back down, we would be implicitly accepting the independence of states outside Hindustan."

 India.03.t: "Collapse of the Sultanate"
 India.03.desc: "The decadence of our Sultan's reign, and the decay of the Sultanate at large has shattered the unity of Hindustan for good. Governor's across the Sultanate have declared their independence, as feudatories distance themselves from our rule. Tribute has stopped flowing, tax collectors have ignored calls to the capital while across our empire, the fires of rebellion threaten what little we have left."
 India.03.a: "The end is near..."
 India.03.b: "A fresh start"
 India.04.t: "Opportunistic Governor"
 India.04.desc: "Our invasion of Hindustan goes well, for Multan has been captured by our forces. In a twist of fate, the Governor of Multan has offered to join our forces, callying forth the full might of the Punjab against the Sultanate of Delhi. Should we accept his offer in exchange for limited autonomy?"
 India.04.a: "Multan shall be ours"
 India.04.b: "We have no need for his support"
 India.05.t: "Multani Rebellion"
 India.05.desc: "The invasion of Timur has lead to an extraordinary betrayal, for the Governor of Multan has broken free of our rule and declared open-rebellion, swearing fealty to the devil at our door."
