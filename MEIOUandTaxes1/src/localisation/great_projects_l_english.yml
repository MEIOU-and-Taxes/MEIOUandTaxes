 hagia_sophia_minarets_desc:1 "The Hagia Sophia was the main church of the Orthodox Christianity. By the time the Muslim took Constantinople, the church had fallen into a state of disrepair. Nevertheless, the Christian cathedral made a strong impression on the new Muslim rulers and they decided to convert it into a mosque. The bells, altar, iconostasis, and sacrificial vessels and other relics were removed and the mosaics depicting Jesus, his Mother Mary, Christian saints and angels were also removed or plastered over. Islamic features—such as the mihrab, minbar, and four minarets—were added."
