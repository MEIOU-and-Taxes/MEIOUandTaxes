 desc_avignon_papacy_reaffirmed:1 "The schism in the Western Roman Church resulted from the return of the papacy to Rome by Gregory XI on January 17, 1377. Pope Gregory announced his intention to return to Avignon, just after the Easter celebrations of 1378. This was at the entreaty of his relatives, his friends, and nearly everyone in his retinue. After Pope Gregory XI died in the Vatican palace on 27 March 1378,[5] the Romans put into operation a plan to ensure the election of a Roman pope. The pope and his Curia were back in Rome after seventy years in Avignon, and the Romans were prepared to do everything in their power to keep them there. They intended to use intimidation and violence (impressio et metus) as their weapons. On April 8, 1378 the cardinals elected a Neapolitan when no viable Roman candidate presented himself. Urban VI, born Bartolomeo Prignano, the Archbishop of Bari, was elected. Urban had been a respected administrator in the papal chancery at Avignon, but as pope he proved suspicious, reformist, and prone to violent outbursts of temper. Many of the cardinals who had elected him soon regretted their decision, the majority removed themselves from Rome to Anagni, where, even though Urban was still reigning, they elected Robert of Geneva as a rival pope on September 20 of the same year, claiming that the election of Urban was invalid because it had been done for fear of the rioting crowds.[8] Elected pope at Fondi on 20 September 1378 by the French cardinals,[9][10] unable to maintain himself in Italy, Robert took the name Clement VII and reestablished a papal court in Avignon, where he became dependent on the French court. Now Avignon Papacy has once again been established as the true head of the catholic church, our nation will continue to enjoy the supports from future Popes.\n§G0.10§!

 kingdom_lotharingia:1 "Kingdom of Lotharingia"
 desc_kingdom_lotharingia:1 "Kingdom of Lotharingia was a successor kingdom of the Carolingian kingdoms. In 953 duke Conrad rebelled against Otto I, was removed from power and replaced by Otto's brother Bruno the Great who finally pacified Lotharingia in 959 by dividing it in Lotharingia superior (Upper Lorraine) under Frederick I and Lotharingia inferior (Lower Lorraine) under Godfrey I. Except for one brief period (1033–44, under Gothelo I), the division was never reversed and the margraves soon raised their separate fiefs into dukedoms. In the twelfth century the ducal authority in Lower Lorraine became fragmented, causing the formation of the Duchy of Limburg and the Duchy of Brabant, whose rulers retained the title Duke of Lothier (derived from "Lotharingia"). With the disappearance of a "lower" Lorraine, the duchy of Upper Lorraine became the primary referent for "Lorraine" within the Holy Roman Empire. With Lorraine and Alsace secured, we can safely assume the defunt Kings of Lotharingia again."

 desc_fra_spanish_union:1 "When Charles II of Spain was clearly near death; the final version of his will left the throne to Louis XIV of France 's grandson Philip, Duke of Anjou. If Philip refused, his younger brother, the duc de Berry was next, followed by Archduke Charles. Sensing that Austria would not accept the outcome and British and Dutch might refuse to enforce a settlement when the sole purpose of settlement was to avoid war. France was again being labelled as an aggressive neighbour when we were enforcing our birthright. We have held on and manage to keep Spain undivied from foreign adversaries and internal struggles. "
