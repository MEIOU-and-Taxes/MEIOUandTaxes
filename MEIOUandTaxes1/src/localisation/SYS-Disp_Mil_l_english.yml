Disp_Mil_Desc: "The §YSize§! of the army is what is actually being levied, changed by (§Gup§! / §Odown§!). §GUp§! is new soldiers recruitment while §ODown§! can be either when casualties happen, when soldiers are being disbanded from the field or a mix of both.\n\nWhen the §YRecruitment Target§! is higher than the size, the province will try to §Grecruit§! new soldiers every year to reach such target. If it's lower, it will slowly §Odisband§! them.\n\nThe §YRecruitment Target§! depends on how much §GSpending§! there is, both in £mil£Power and ¤Money. Recruitment target can be bottlenecked by either of them. For increasing £mil£Power, it can be done in the §TDelegate Tax Code§! decision, while ¤Spending can be done in the Estates interface, by clicking on the §TNational Armies§! interaction."
