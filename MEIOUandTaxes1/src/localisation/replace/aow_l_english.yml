 desc_mal_wangaras_upset:0 "By forcefully limiting the contact allowed with Portuguese traders we have at the same time managed to alienate our own merchant caste, the Wangaras.

 flavor_mal.4.t:0 "The Wangara and the [mali_european_trading_partner.Culture.GetName] Traders"
 flavor_mal.4.d:0 "Having adopted a less violent approach, [mali_european_trading_partner.Culture.GetName] traders have become an increasingly common sight along our western coasts. In many ways this is a boon to our state as it has given us much easier access to horses for our armies and a way to procure valuable goods from the many exotic ports frequented by [mali_european_trading_partner.Culture.GetName] merchants. For gold or slaves there is not much the [mali_european_trading_partner.Culture.GetName] wouldn't sell us and our merchant caste, the Wangara, is thriving due to this new partnership.\nThere is, however, a slight worry about this development in some camps, the amount of slaves to a horse seem to keep increasing by the day and while our own transoceanic ventures haven't gone so well it would seem less than prudent to rely entirely on these foreign merchants as they surely can't have our best interests at heart."
 flavor_mal.4.a:0 "Ok."
 flavor_mal.5.t:0 "[mali_european_trading_partner.Culture.GetName] Meddling"
 flavor_mal.5.d:0 "The [mali_european_trading_partner.Culture.GetName] traders on our western coast have become quite a nuisance lately. While the horses they bring for our armies and the exotic goods they bring from far away countries are of great use to us it seems they cannot help but meddle in the local politics. It is clear that several chiefs that are in contact with the [mali_european_trading_partner.Culture.GetName] have been encouraged to extend their personal authority and to slowly attempt to cut the ties with our central administration.\nIn order to deal with this we could either strike at the chiefs themselves or attempt to limit the influence of the [mali_european_trading_partner.Culture.GetName]."

 flavor_mal.6.t:0 "Islamization of the Aristocracy"
 flavor_mal.6.d:0 "While our kingdom is Islamic in name the old religion of our forefathers is still very much a force to be reckoned with. Islam has, however, been gaining more ground lately among the aristocracy and wandering marabouts have also become an increasingly common sight even in the farthest corners of our lands.\nIn the past our predecessors have all avoided trying to be too forceful about converting their subjects but if we wish we could probably make use of these recent developments to encourage the spread of the true faith."
 flavor_mal.6.a:0 "Let us convert our people!"

 flavor_mal.7.t:0 "Unsafe Roads"
 flavor_mal.7.d:0 "The time needed to complete a journey from our capital to the coast has risen alarmingly due to the direct route being plagued by bandits, Fulani raiders and local chiefs hoping to enrich themselves by waylaying the rich Wangara traders.\nUnless we attempt to address this issue soon we may find ourselves losing contact with the outlying parts of our empire."

 flavor_mal.8.t:0 "Rise of Kaabu"
 flavor_mal.8.d:0 "Sami Koli, the governor of Kaabu is accusing us of neglecting the coastal trading areas of our empire. He has now threatened to sever the ties with us completely and has started to deal with the European trading nations directly rather than as our representative. Never very committed to the Malian state religion Kaabu has grown to be a stronghold of the local traditional religion and its new rulers have been quick to use this against us.\nWith a strong religious identity and its Atlantic trade ties Kaabu has every chance of becoming a durable state. If we are to stop this we should probably act as soon as possible."
 flavor_mal.8.a:0 "We must crush these rebels!"
 flavor_mal.8.b:0 "We will have to deal with them later."
