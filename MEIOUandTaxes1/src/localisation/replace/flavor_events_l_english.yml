 flavor_bav.201.n:1 "The Duchy of Bavaria"
 flavor_bav.201.t:1 "From the sixth to eighth century, the Duchy of Bavaria was a frontier region in the southeastern part of the Merovingian kingdom and was ruled by dukes under Frankish lordship. In the late ninth century a new duchy was created from this area. It was one of the stem duchies of the Kingdom of Germany and the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nBetween 1070 and 1180 the Emperor was opposed by Bavaria, especially by the House of Welf. In the final conflict between Duke Henry the Lion and the Hohenstaufen emperor Frederick I, Frederick triumphed and deprived Henry of his fiefs. Bavaria then passed over to the House of Wittelsbach. Since there was no preference for succession of the firstborn in the Wittelsbach dynasty, Bavaria was subdivided between different branches of the Wittelsbach dynasty into separate duchies, often at odds with one another.\n\nWe believe ourselves to be the sole legitimate claimant to the united Duchy of Bavaria. No longer shall we abide with mediocrity."

 red_turban.5.d:1 "Descendants of the Great Khan no longer are able to execute any kind of control in the areas populated by Han people. With last battles and lost sieges the population turned completely against us, our provincial officials were killed, our garrisons expelled and control taken by Han. Small areas which are still under our control are held only by the might of our armies. Should they leave even those small holdouts will turn over to the Han."
 red_turban.6.t:1 "The Yuan Anarchy"
 red_turban.6.d:1 "As the last Han city falls, any semblance of order has been shattered. The failing remnants of our bureaucracy have abandoned us, and our people have fled north in return, leaving little trace of the administration that once defined the Yuan behind. As we return to the old ways, a former official known as Naghacu has rallied the eastern lands of the Sungliao, unifying the Mongols and Hulun under the Urianqad banner. While our time may be near, there is a chance that Naghacu can restore the dynasty to rule once more."

The last Mongols south of the wall are lost forever, and those who fled north have dispersed into the many clans claiming the legacy of the great Genghis.\n\nHope may still remain. At the heart of the plateau, the Borgijin princes have sent envoys across the steppe, rallying the clans under a new Khan claiming the mantle of Kublai himself. While much has been lost, we may yet have a chance to preserve the unity of the Mongols."

While issuing grand construction projects and modernising the country, part of the reason for his success was his firm rule and ruthlessness. Where previous viceroys had failed to exert control over the kingdom, \"Don Pedro\" closed down humanist institutions and instituted harsh penalties for petty crimes. He centralised national institutions, and moved every court to the Castel Capuano. By breaking up traditional land holdings, barons were forced to move to the city where they would be within reach of de Toledo's government.\n\nHe failed in introducing the Spanish Inquisition in Naples, however, as revolts forced the Spanish king to retract the order. De Toledo passed away shortly after, in 1552, while on state business in Siena, ensuring that his legacy of state building would forever outshine the harshness of his rule."

He also commissioned a new palace for the Viceroy, which was then surrounded by buildings in square-grid streets. The Spanish Quarter, as it was called, was the first of its kind in Europe, and is still one of the most distinct areas of Naples. The express goal was to make Naples invulnerable, but it also had the side effect of making it the second largest city in Europe at the time. By his death in 1552, the legacy of the harsh ruler as a city-builder was more than secure, and Naples would continue to be a centre of southern European power for centuries."

The two were the seneschal Corfitz Ulfeldt and the governor of Norway Hannibal Sehested, who were both married to Frederik's half-sisters. The king's heroic conduct during the siege of Copenhagen in the winter of 1659 had, in addition, made him widely popular at a time when the nobility and the Rigsråd were increasingly being discredited. In October 1660, these events led the estates - the nobility only reluctantly - to create a hereditary monarchy. The new system meant that the king was no longer dependant on the Rigsråd, and he immediately used his new power to introduce absolutism, which was temporarily established on 10 January 1661 in the Hereditary Monarchy Act before being fully set out in Kongeloven (the King's Law) of 1665, the basic law of Danish absolutism."

Instead of finishing the Russians, Charles moved against August II of Poland-Saxony and drove him out of Poland in 1704, having the pro-Swedish Stanislaw Leszczynski elected King. Then he subjugated Saxony in 1706. While the Russians started the construction of St. Petersburg (1703) and rebuilt their armies, they also took parts of Estland (1704-1706). Charles then decided to march to Moscow via Ukraine where the Cossacks under Mazeppa had again risen in revolt (1708). The harsh winter and Russian raids decimated his army and he was finally beaten at the battle of Poltava in 1709. The wounded king escaped to the Ottomans. The Russians were encircled by the Ottomans on the Prut River, but Peter succeeded through bribery to obtain a safe conduct in exchange for Azov. While Charles was still exiled in Turkey, Russian, Danish, Hanoverian and even Prussian troops captured most of the Swedish lands around the Baltic.
