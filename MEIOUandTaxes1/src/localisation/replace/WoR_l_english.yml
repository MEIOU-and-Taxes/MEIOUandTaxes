 war_of_the_roses.1.d:0 "In the halls of Westminster, whispers grow louder, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], once seen as a pious and gentle ruler, has fallen into fits of incoherence and melancholy. He speaks to no one for days, then raves about visions of angels and enemies unseen.\nThe governance of the realm falters as the court scrambles to maintain stability. Nobles and powerful factions see an opportunity — or a disaster — looming. With a mad [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] upon the throne, England teeters on the edge of chaos."

 war_of_the_roses.3.d:0 "With the mind of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] shattered by sickness and divine visions, England finds itself rudderless. The affairs of state cannot be neglected, nor can the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s authority go entirely unrepresented. A regent must be chosen to govern in his name.\nAt court, two powerful figures emerge as rivals for this crucial role; Margaret of Anjou, the indomitable Queen, and Richard, Duke of York, a man of royal blood, military reputation, and popular support among many nobles.\nEach promises stability — but behind every promise lies ambition.\nMargaret, fierce and cunning, seeks to preserve the rights of her husband and their young son, Prince Edward. Her enemies whisper that she would rule in all but name, entrenching her power and that of her allies at court.\nRichard, claiming descent from Edward III, casts himself as the guardian of the realm, protector against misrule — but his lineage makes him a potential threat to [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s very throne.\nThe court holds its breath. The nobles sharpen their daggers. The common folk murmur of civil war.\nNow the burden of choice falls to you; who shall govern England while the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] sits in the shadows of his mind?"

 war_of_the_roses.4.d:0 "After long months — nay, years — of despair and uncertainty, a miracle has shaken the court of England.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], once lost in the mists of madness, has stirred from his torpor. His eyes, once hollow, now shine with clarity. His voice, once rambling and broken, now speaks with the steady authority of a sovereign.\n\nCourtiers fall to their knees in astonishment. The common folk murmur that the hand of God has touched the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle].\n\nBut with the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s recovery comes a difficult reckoning. During his affliction, the realm was governed by a regent — be it Margaret of Anjou, fierce in defense of the royal cause, or Richard, Duke of York, proud and ambitious in his stewardship. Neither is likely to yield power easily.\n\nTo restore the proper rule of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], the regent must be dismissed. Yet removing them will not be simple: loyalties have been forged, ambitions nurtured, and rivalries enflamed during [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s long absence from governance.\n\nThe Kingdom watches anxiously: will the restoration of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] bring true peace, or will it spark an even greater crisis?"

 war_of_the_roses.5.d:0 "With [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s madness clouding [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] judgment and the regency struggling to hold the reins of power, the governance of the realm has become a subject of heated debate.\n\nSome whisper that order and justice have prevailed despite adversity, crediting wise ministers, loyal nobles, and the guiding hand of Providence. Others grumble of corruption, heavy taxation, favoritism, and broken promises.\n\nThe truth may lie somewhere in between — but perception shapes power as much as reality. The reputation of the government, for good or ill, now hangs in the balance."

The streets of the town ran red with blood as fierce fighting broke out amidst the narrow lanes.\n\nYork's army, swift and well-prepared, seized the advantage, scattering the Lancastrian defenders.

The Percies in turn accuse the Nevilles of tyranny and ambition.\n\nThe bloodshed between these two mighty houses threatens to destabilize the entire realm.\n\nAs Shakespeare would later write: 'Civil blood makes civil hands unclean.'"

 war_of_the_roses.9.d:0 "The garrison at Calais, unpaid and restless, has turned to piracy to fill its coffers.\n\nEnglish ships flying false flags have attacked merchants from the Hanseatic League and Castile, plundering their goods and seizing their ships in the Channel.\n\nOutraged, the Hanseatic cities and the Castilian court demand reparations and punishment for the pirates. Our reputation abroad suffers, and there are whispers that retaliation may follow if these insults are not addressed.\n\nOur proud garrison defends its actions as 'taking just payment' for services rendered — but the damage to our standing is clear."

 war_of_the_roses.11.d:0 "For years, the Duke of York has claimed only the role of Protector of the Realm, insisting on his loyalty to [Root.Monarch.GetName].\n\nNow, he has cast aside all pretense. Richard of York openly asserts his descent from the royal Plantagenet line, declaring that his blood is purer and his right to rule stronger than that of the House of Lancaster.\n\nThrough his mother, Anne Mortimer, York descends from Lionel of Antwerp, the second surviving son of Edward III, a senior line compared to John of Gaunt, the third son, from whom the current [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] decebds from. Though his bloodline passes through a woman, York insists that the principle of primogeniture — inheritance through the eldest line — outweighs the objections of gender.\n\nWith this bold declaration, York demands recognition as the true heir to the throne. Whispers of warfare grow louder across the kingdom, as nobles and commons alike forced to choose between York and Lancaster."

These 'affinities' — personal armies loyal not to [Root.Monarch.GetName], but to great lords — grow ever larger and more dangerous.\n\nWith the crown's authority weakened and private military forces swelling, ambitious nobles see new opportunities to defy royal power.
