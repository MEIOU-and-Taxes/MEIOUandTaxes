 tributary_events.2.d:1 "As a part of the [Root.Overlord.GetAdjective] tributary sphere we are increasingly becoming part of the wider [Root.Overlord.GetAdjective] cultural world. The [Root.Overlord.GetLanguageName] language can be heard in the streets and even the high halls of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName], and there is a growing awareness of our country in the [Root.Overlord.GovernmentName] of [Root.Overlord.GetName]."

In many courts the [Root.GetLanguageName] language is seen now as the language of diplomacy and culture and our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] figures as an authority in the minds of men and women far beyond our borders."
