 administrative_ideas:1 "Administrative Ideas" #Admin
 administrative_ideas_bonus:1 "Fully Administrative"
 administrative_ideas_1:1 "Duty to Protect"
 administrative_ideas_1_desc:1 "Arguably the most important duty of any ruler to their people is that of protection. Scholars might debate to what ills such protection should extend, but there is no arguing that from the dominion of a foreign ruler, it is always owing."
 administrative_ideas_2:1 "Restrained Abuses"
 administrative_ideas_2_desc:1 "There are benefits to debasement and deception, but if they are to be had, people must trust the coinage in the first place. Perhaps there is more to this business than meets the eye?"
 administrative_ideas_3:1 "Proactive Measures"
 administrative_ideas_3_desc:1 "The fact of the matter is that sometimes reacting is not enough. A good ruler must be seen as seizing the initiative whenever possible, both at home and abroad. A light touch might be mistaken for incompetence- or worse, indifference."
 administrative_ideas_4:1 "Counselled Action"
 administrative_ideas_4_desc:1 "'Listen, consult your Council, but decide yourself.' - Louis XIV, King of France. Indeed, only a fool governs solely on his own counsel- no single eye may see every pitfall. It is in understanding this that makes a ruler wise- and in acting upon it, great."
 administrative_ideas_5:1 "Delegation"
 administrative_ideas_5_desc:1 "Even the strongest rulers require the assistance of others. It might even be said that the strongest are those who make the strengths of their subordinates their own, making best use of their own time by applying the efforts of others better suited to the task."
 administrative_ideas_6:1 "Vested Interests"
 administrative_ideas_6_desc:1 "Who benefits from your indecision? Who is hurt by this advice, and who gains by it? Is your counsellor friends with the governor, or your minister rivals with another? Understanding the complex network of stakes, relationships and plans that others have in the game allows you to outplay them, and be the better ruler for it."
 administrative_ideas_7:1 "Permanent Networks"
 administrative_ideas_7_desc:1 "The running of a country necessitates certain activities- the passing of messages, the movement of troops, dignitaries and agents, and the transport of materials. Any ruler who seeks dominion over more than their own residence must arrange for all these things to happen regularly and without interruption.\nProvincial Corruption from Autonomy: §G-10.0%§!"
 
 aristocracy_ideas:1 "Aristocracy Ideas" #Aristo
 aristocracy_ideas_bonus:1 "Fully Aristocracy"
 aristocracy_ideas_bonus_desc:1 "\nBase Hierarchy: §G+1.0§! \nHierarchy Concern: §G+10.0%§!"
 aristocracy_ideas_1:1 "The Honest Serf"
 aristocracy_ideas_1_desc:1 ""Tireless work builds moral character! Hm, what about me? Oh, I could never." \nHerding Skill: §G+5.0%§! \nAgriculture Skill: §G+5.0%§! \nYearly Peasant Freedom: §G-0.2§! \nPeasant Needs: §G-5.0%§!"
 aristocracy_ideas_2:1 "Noble Buildings"
 aristocracy_ideas_2_desc:1 "From the gorgeous manors to the grandeur castles, our nobles bring glory and fame to the ruler. \nMetalworking Skill: §G+10.0%§!"
 aristocracy_ideas_3:1 "Social Hierarchy"
 aristocracy_ideas_3_desc:1 "Some people are better than others - be it by virtue of status, heritage or power. Nobility is merely recognition of those differences, and an effort by the state to ensure that the worthy are treated as such. \nNoble Tax Cost: §G-10.0%§! \nNoble Levy Mana Cost: §G-5.0%§! \nNoble Investment in Feudal Levies: §G+30.0%§!"
 aristocracy_ideas_4:1 "Universal Nobility"
 aristocracy_ideas_4_desc:1 "In other realms, it is easy enough to make the distinction between commoners and nobles. Syncretising the various noble hierarchies we encounter with our own is simply a matter of courtesy."
 aristocracy_ideas_5:1 "Natural Relationship"
 aristocracy_ideas_5_desc:1 "The state and the nobility are natural partners. Nobility is a system which requires a state to enforce it, and the state likewise benefits from the existence of a powerful class of individudals that rely on it."
 aristocracy_ideas_6:1 "The Expendable Serf"
 aristocracy_ideas_6_desc:1 "What greater cause is there than to die for their master? \nAvailable Manpower Pool: §G+5.0%§!"
 aristocracy_ideas_7:1 "Noble Convenience"
 aristocracy_ideas_7_desc:1 ""Our recent anti-corruption campaign against the elites has been a great success! But I can't help but think that we forgot someone..." \nCorruption from Elites: §G-5.0%§! \nCorruption from Nobles: §G+5.0%§! \nNoble Power Weight for Corruption Share: §G+10.0%§!"
 
 bureaucracy_ideas:1 "Bureaucracy Ideas" #Bureau
 bureaucracy_ideas_bonus:1 "Fully Bureaucracy"
 bureaucracy_ideas_1:1 "Professional Administration"
 bureaucracy_ideas_1_desc:1 "Does a cobbler understand how to run a farm? Does a farmer grasp the vagaries of shipping? A merchant those of war, or a noble those of theology? The answer to all these questions is no, and for the state it should be no different: who better to govern than those who make a job of it?\nAdministration Cost: §G-10.0%§!"
 bureaucracy_ideas_2:1 "Apparatus of State"
 bureaucracy_ideas_2_desc:1 "Government is only as real as it is effective. A law unenforced is no law at all, and any state worth its salt will have many laws, necessitating a veritable army of executors, versatile and competent enough to be arranged in whatever way gets the job done."
 bureaucracy_ideas_3:1 "Institutional Governance"
 bureaucracy_ideas_3_desc:1 "A state is not merely a ruler and their government, it is an idea: that laws persist past their makers, that rules may outlive their rulers, that though there may have been many monarchs, there has only ever been one Crown.\nRuler Authority: §Y-10.0%§!\nInstitutional Authority: §Y+10.0%§!"
 bureaucracy_ideas_4:1 "Undivided Loyalty"
 bureaucracy_ideas_4_desc:1 "A minion with many masters is no minion at all. A regular paycheck and a life of service undistracted by courtly intrigues or a second job does wonders for the loyalty- or at least acquiescence- of most people, not least of all those working in government."
 bureaucracy_ideas_5:1 "Systemic Oversight"
 bureaucracy_ideas_5_desc:1 "Who watches the watchmen? In a bureaucracy, the answer is always: more watchmen. It is a fact of life that with power comes the potential for corruption, and where vetting fails, a more systematic approach must be used to fend off the bane of good government."
 bureaucracy_ideas_6:1 "Omnipresence"
 bureaucracy_ideas_6_desc:1 "In a civilised society, the presence of government in a person's life is not a possibility- it is a fact. Even those who deliberately separate themselves from society do not escape government, as it is government which makes it possible for them to do so in peace.\nYearly Clan Power: §Y-0.20§!"
 bureaucracy_ideas_7:1 "Government by Government"
 bureaucracy_ideas_7_desc:1 "It is a sad government indeed which enforces rules it did not make. The true power of government is in its sovereignty, and as such the only source of law is that which stems from the permission of- and responsibility to- the government.\nImpact of Increase State Reach interaction: §G+50%§!"
 
 culture_ideas:1 "Culture Ideas" #Culture
 culture_ideas_bonus:1 "Fully Culture"
 culture_ideas_1:1 "Leisurely Pursuits"
 culture_ideas_1_desc:1 "With great responsibility comes great entitlement to its benefits. It is only by appreciating the joys of life that leaders can understand how to properly bring them to their subjects.\nBase Diversions: §G+1.00§!"
 culture_ideas_2:1 "Prestigious Court"
 culture_ideas_2_desc:1 "Establishing a court worth talking about in another court is no trifling matter, when competitors often have the resources of entire states at their disposal. It is often, then, the anticipation of future fashions that separates a court seen as decadent from that seen as extravagant."
 culture_ideas_3:1 "Patronage of the Arts"
 culture_ideas_3_desc:1 "Being a patron is not simply a matter of charity or even of self-aggrandisement: there is a certain expectation that a leader will provide for the great minds of the time, so they may express themselves without needing to waste time on unartistic endeavours such as begging."
 culture_ideas_4:1 "Academic Endowments"
 culture_ideas_4_desc:1 "Education is not simply utilitarian- it is something to be had for its own sake- and to be given generous grants as a demonstration of our leader's generosity.\nAcademic District Cost: §G-10.0%§!"
 culture_ideas_5:1 "Multilingualism"
 culture_ideas_5_desc:1 "Most of the upper classes tend to be at least fluent in the dialect of the capital and that of their homeland, but the genuinely cosmopolitan of them also learn the languages of the classics, and of the great powers."
 culture_ideas_6:1 "Learned Administration"
 culture_ideas_6_desc:1 "There are many benefits to an educated administration- and aside from those obvious ones like numeracy and literacy, education also broadens the mind to an extent which makes conceiving of- and executing- new ideas that much easier."
 culture_ideas_7:1 "Open Minds"
 culture_ideas_7_desc:1 "There comes a point in one's exposure to and subsequent understanding of foreign experiences that one begins to.. if not expect the unexpected, then certainly not be surprised by it. Simply put, it is difficult to be outraged when you yourself have become familiar with so many formerly outrageous things."
 
 diplomacy_ideas:1 "Diplomacy Ideas" #Diplo
 diplomacy_ideas_bonus:1 "Fully Diplomacy"
 diplomacy_ideas_1:1 "Flexible Offers"
 diplomacy_ideas_1_desc:1 "No offer is really final. We're just waiting for one we can't refuse."
 diplomacy_ideas_2:1 "War Negotiation"
 diplomacy_ideas_2_desc:1 "If war is the continuation of politics by other means, then wartime diplomacy is the continuation of peacetime diplomacy by exactly the same means."
 diplomacy_ideas_3:1 "Ongoing Employment"
 diplomacy_ideas_3_desc:1 "Some diplomats are better at their jobs than others. It's best we hang on to those ones."
 diplomacy_ideas_4:1 "Influential Diplomats"
 diplomacy_ideas_4_desc:1 "Diplomacy is a game of personality as much as raw power. The best diplomats are those whose personalities allow them to best project that raw power to our desired ends."
 diplomacy_ideas_5:1 "Foreign Networks"
 diplomacy_ideas_5_desc:1 "Keep your friends close and your enemies closer- but when that fails, keep some of your friends close to your enemies.\nAlliance Limit: §G+1§!"
 diplomacy_ideas_6:1 "Statecraft"
 diplomacy_ideas_6_desc:1 "Diplomacy isn't just about making deals and agreements. It's also about making a place for one's country in the world, with both a reputation and a bloc to call home."
 diplomacy_ideas_7:1 "Benign Intent"
 diplomacy_ideas_7_desc:1 "Sometimes we honestly mean well. Whether that's via a quid pro quo, a win-win situation, or honest charity, nobody should ignore that fact."
 
 economic_ideas:1 "Economic Ideas" #Econ
 economic_ideas_bonus:1 "Fully Economic\nKnowledge Output: §G+10.0%§!"
 economic_ideas_1:1 "Policy Regime"
 economic_ideas_1_desc:1 "Economies respond well to rules and trust in institutions. Taking advantage of this might necessitate a commitment to certain promises. An alien concept indeed."
 economic_ideas_2:1 "Public Infrastructure"
 economic_ideas_2_desc:1 "Some things bring benefit to more people than just their owners or operators- but building them is often disruptive and to the detriment of other proprietors. This warrants state involvement.\nPathing Infrastructure Cost: §G-10.0%§!"
 economic_ideas_3:1 "Security of Property"
 economic_ideas_3_desc:1 "Ownership means responsibility as well as returns. Ensuring that a farm worked today will be there tomorrow makes maintaining and improving that farm a more attractive prospect."
 economic_ideas_4:1 "Stewards of Currency"
 economic_ideas_4_desc:1 "It may be time to abandon our old relationship with money. Though debasement makes for tempting short-term gains, the benefits of reliable money- and a government people will trust with it- are too good to pass up."
 economic_ideas_5:1 "Managing Expectations"
 economic_ideas_5_desc:1 "As it turns out, many people are willing to loan us money if we actually make a decent effort at paying it back. How were we supposed to know that declaring bankruptcy every generation would scare creditors off?"
 economic_ideas_6:1 "Targeted Investment"
 economic_ideas_6_desc:1 "Certain industries are of benefit to the state outside of their immediate economic value- but it is a confusing mess trying to identify which truly are, and which are just run by your advisors' nephews."
 economic_ideas_7:1 "Intangible Property"
 economic_ideas_7_desc:1 "If ownership of physical property begets investment in it, then perhaps invention itself is an enterprise which one invests in? A novel prospect, but one which might hold the key to a new age..\nEducation Skill: §G+15.0%§!"
 
 eminence_ideas:1 "Eminence Ideas" #Eminen
 eminence_ideas_bonus:1 "Fully Eminence"
 eminence_ideas_1:1 "Diplomatic Cover"
 eminence_ideas_1_desc:1 "Diplomacy is not just about speaking. It is also about listening.\n\nAnd sometimes massive bribes."
 eminence_ideas_2:1 "Statesmen"
 eminence_ideas_2_desc:1 "If statecraft is about establishing a place for one's country internationally, then statesmen are the ones who are masters of the art."
 eminence_ideas_3:1 "Cordial Relations"
 eminence_ideas_3_desc:1 "Some countries get along. We can do that too, if we try hard enough."
 eminence_ideas_4:1 "Imperial Ambitions"
 eminence_ideas_4_desc:1 "Imperialism is a normal part of a country's lifecycle. What's important is that it is expressed in a safe and responsible manner."
 eminence_ideas_5:1 "Fair Cause"
 eminence_ideas_5_desc:1 "Sometimes, nobody can really blame you. It just so happens that we are particularly blameless."
 eminence_ideas_6:1 "Global Networks"
 eminence_ideas_6_desc:1 "Some places are really far away. Some places are important. Sometimes they are both. That's when it pays to have global networks."
 eminence_ideas_7:1 "All Realms"
 eminence_ideas_7_desc:1 "Every country is equally deserving of our attention, whether they want it or not.\nAlliance Limit: §G+1§!"
 
 empire_ideas:1 "Empire Ideas" #Empire
 empire_ideas_bonus:1 "Fully Empire"
 empire_ideas_1:1 "Law and Order"
 empire_ideas_1_desc:1 "An empire is by definition the dominion of one people over others. What makes one cohesive, then, is not any natural bonds its population might share, but the visibility of that dominion's benefits, and the subtlety of its downsides.\nNational Civil War Strength: §G-15.0%§!"
 empire_ideas_2:1 "Exceptionalism"
 empire_ideas_2_desc:1 "We are extraordinary in all things. In all affairs, we are central. The rules which bind others merely guide us. And the challenges which others face, we shall never see. It is this fact that elevates us above all others, and motivates our rulers to bring us closer to greatness."
 empire_ideas_3:1 "Internal Structure"
 empire_ideas_3_desc:1 "Only weak and feeble powers hand away control to lesser domains within themselves. True empires impose themselves upon such powers, and ensure that all within understand that only from the basis of meeting their obligations to the larger realm may they exercise self-rule.\nElite Power from Autonomy: §G-10.0%§!"
 empire_ideas_4:1 "Our Justice"
 empire_ideas_4_desc:1 "There is a natural order to things that we will only permit so much diversion from. To even threaten to depart from our way is to do wrong- in this, no power is sovereign but our own.\nCapitol Infrastructure Cost: §G-10.0%§!"
 empire_ideas_5:1 "Universal Realm"
 empire_ideas_5_desc:1 "What marks the proper borders of an empire? Not the presence of a different people, more of whom may always be brought into the fold. Nor is it a rival power, which exist to be encroached upon. No. By right of force and destiny, it is the empire which chooses where its borders lie, and no others.\nPathing Infrastructure Cost: §G-5.0%§!"
 empire_ideas_6:1 "Opportunistic Antagonism"
 empire_ideas_6_desc:1 "An enemy can be just as valuable an asset as an ally. In managing hostilities with foreign powers, the objective of a good statesman is to make sure that enemies are simultaneously visible, tolerable and negligible, maximising the benefits any conflict might yield whilst minimising the risks."
 empire_ideas_7:1 "One Will"
 empire_ideas_7_desc:1 "A ship only has one captain, and an empire can only truly have one state. Although we may permit our people their own affairs, even (in some things) their own governments, when push comes to shove there is no denying who grants these privileges, and who can take them away.\nCorruption from Local Autonomy: §G-5.0%§!"

 engineering_ideas_2:1 "Robustness"
 engineering_ideas_2_desc:1 "A plan which assumes ideal conditions is a bad plan. Contingency is the bedrock of success."
 engineering_ideas_3:1 "Simplicity"
 engineering_ideas_3_desc:1 "If someone asks for bread, do not give them cake. They might come to expect it."
 engineering_ideas_4:1 "Uniformity"
 engineering_ideas_4_desc:1 "Character is subordinate to function. Include it only when it fulfils your intentions."
 engineering_ideas_5:1 "Specification"
 engineering_ideas_5_desc:1 "Nothing is worth everything. Establish when cost will turn success into failure."
 engineering_ideas_6:1 "Purpose"
 engineering_ideas_6_desc:1 "Every action has intent. Success is the sum of actions intending to achieve it."

 colonialism_ideas_2:1 "Colonial Office"
 colonialism_ideas_2_desc:1 "A proper commitment to establishing colonies warrants the arrangement of dedicated administrators to oversee and promote the development of sponsored colonies."

 colonialism_ideas_5:1 "Mercantilist Tendencies"
 colonialism_ideas_5_desc:1 "A colonial domain is one which is both foreign and domestic simultaenously. There is a temptation to jealously guard the fruits of virgin lands."
 colonialism_ideas_6:1 "Commercial Lifeline"
 colonialism_ideas_6_desc:1 "A colony's relationship with the motherland is compromised of two factors: economics and politics. Whilst the politics can shift dramatically, the fact is that only the greatest, best-established settlements can survive outside of the commercial environment of their homeland. That's what we tell them, anyway.\nMerchants from Trade Centers: §G+25.0%§!"
 colonialism_ideas_7:1 "Imperial Precedent"
 colonialism_ideas_7_desc:1 "What makes a native deserving of our overlordship that is not true of anyone?"

 espionage_ideas_2:1 "Loyalty"
 espionage_ideas_2_desc:1 "It might seem like a contradiction, but the most valuable characteristic of any agent in a covert mission is loyalty- to their cause, and to their master.\nNational Civil War Strength: §G-25.0%§!"
 espionage_ideas_3:1 "Fabrication"
 espionage_ideas_3_desc:1 "Whether about a person, a place, the past, the present or the future, sometimes you just have to lie to get the job done."
 espionage_ideas_4:1 "Training"
 espionage_ideas_4_desc:1 "There are some tricks of the trade when it comes to espionage. Make eye contact. Don't make too much eye contact. Preferably, don't get seen at all."
 espionage_ideas_5:1 "Informants"
 espionage_ideas_5_desc:1 "Information is as powerful a weapon as any fire lit underneath a haystack- when your enemy believes you do not know that which you do, they are ripe for walking into a trap."
 espionage_ideas_6:1 "Civilian Involvement"
 espionage_ideas_6_desc:1 "Some people don't have to know anything about your plan to help you. Some people need only know who you seek to hurt. Others, only need a little coin. Regardless of their reasons, their help is equally valuable.\nElite Power from Autonomy: §G-10.0%§!"
 espionage_ideas_7:1 "Counterespionage"
 espionage_ideas_7_desc:1 "Only a fool believes their enemies incapable of thinking as they do. It is easy enough to forget that espionage is a dance between two players.\nCorruption from Elites: §G-7.5%§!"

 expansion_ideas_5:1 "A Place in the Sun"
 expansion_ideas_5_desc:1 "Hardly seems fair that other realms expand across the globe and we be left at home. We should stake our claim to a place among the colonial powers."
 expansion_ideas_6:1 "Making Trails"
 expansion_ideas_6_desc:1 "These are the pioneers of a tradition that will last many years, plotters of courses to be used by merchants and travellers for centuries to come."

 exploration_ideas_6:1 "Civilising Mission"

 grand_fleet_ideas_4_desc:1 "A navy is often not in immediate proximity to a well-provisioned port when in need of supplies. As a solution, rather than sailing back to such a port and risking the possibility of needless expenditure, fleets will now be required to sail to the nearest strategic cache, which will probably have a stock of water and biscuits to tide them over till next shoreleave."

 trade_ideas_2:1 "Safe Routes"
 trade_ideas_2_desc:1 "Risk, they say. It's all about risk. This is code for 'spend more on patrols'. Regardless of our fiscal commitments, there is safety in numbers- and nothing makes for numbers like high traffic."
 trade_ideas_3:1 "Trade Posts"
 trade_ideas_3_desc:1 "Trading houses permit people from outside a locale to exchange goods with the locals without interacting with customs themselves. As long as we get our cut, we don't care who pays."
 trade_ideas_4:1 "Reasonable Regulation"
 trade_ideas_4_desc:1 "Merchants all seem obsessed with dealing in terribly complicated matters, lending and mutualising, shares in risk and interests in ownership, dividends for joint options.. it's all too difficult to regulate in fine detail, and lord only knows who could be bothered to remember such rules."
 trade_ideas_5:1 "Imports and Exports"
 trade_ideas_5_desc:1 "Things go in and things go out. Merchants seem bent on making this all more complicated, with their international supply chains and quadrilateral agreements. How can three men all simultaneously own the same five warehouses in four different cities and still sleep at night?"
 trade_ideas_6:1 "Barriers to Trade"
 trade_ideas_6_desc:1 "We have to be careful about how we go about raising money. There are many instances where raising a tax or selling a license actually can reduce our revenue. Even less obvious obstacles, such as whose petitions are heard, can discourage enterprise."
 trade_ideas_7:1 "Right of Commerce"
 trade_ideas_7_desc:1 "As an economy grows more complex, the question of who ought to be able to engage in trade- both between settlements and in certain goods- as well as who may make use of certain legal instruments and institutions becomes increasingly complex.
