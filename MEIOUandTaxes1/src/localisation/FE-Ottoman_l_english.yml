 Ottomans.001.t: "Death of Suleyman Pasha"
 Ottomans.001.d: "To the despair of our Great Sultan Orhan, his favoured heir Suleyman has tragically lost his life in a hunting accident at the frontier. The loss of his treasured son has seen Orhan's health take a turn for the worse, leaving many functions of state in the hands of his second son Murad."
 Ottomans.001.a: "A great loss..."
 Ottomans.002.t: "Death of Orhan"
 Ottomans.002.d: "Today marks the end of an era, for Orhan has passed away to Allah. His conquests and unification of our lands were glorious, his rule just, and his heirs more than capable."
 Ottomans.002.a: "He is with Allah now..."
 Ottomans.003.t: "Kidnapping of Halil"
 Ottomans.003.d: "To the further despair of Orhan, another son has been lost, this time by kidnapping. Prince of our Beylik, Sehzade Halil has been abducted near Izmit, and is being held for ransom at the Aegean port of Phocaea. We could attempt to retrieve him and pay the ransom, yet our fleet is inexperienced and the local Genoese are of no help. Only the Rumeli have the fleet and connections to truly see this through, should we ask them for help?"
 Ottomans.003.a: "The Rumeli will help us for a truce"
 Ottomans.003.b: "We will find him ourselves"
 Ottomans.003.c: "Foolish child, he's on his own"
 Ottomans.004.t: "Kidnapping of Halil"
 Ottomans.004.d: "In a marked turn of fortunes, the Ottomans have come to us for aid. Their Prince, Sehzade Halil, has been kidnapped and is held for ransom at the Aegean port of Phocaea. With our fleet and Ottoman backing, we could pay the ransom and retrieve Halil. The Ottomans are willing to sign a truce, buying us crucial time to regain our strength. Should we accept?"
 Ottomans.004.a: "We will help, for a truce"
 Ottomans.004.b: "No truce, they can't be trusted..."
 Ottomans.005.t: "Rumeli Aid"
 Ottomans.005.d: "The Rumeli have agreed to our terms and are sending their fleet to retrieve Halil. Peace will reign for a time, and our foolish Prince will be returned to us."
 Ottomans.005.a: "Surely good news for Orhan"
 Ottomans.006.t: "Rumeli Insult"
 Ottomans.006.d: "Disgraceful dogs, the Rumeli have refused our terms. Should we send in our fleet for a chance at success, or abandon the prince?"
 Ottomans.007.t: "Results of the Expedition"
 Ottomans.007.d: "The inevitable has occured, for our small fleet has failed to retrieve the prince. Though the pirates are slain, Halil has died with them, and Orhan has taken a further turn for the worst."
 Ottomans.007.a: "Terrible news..."
 Ottomans.008.t: "Results of the Expedition"
 Ottomans.008.d: "It seems Allah is with us, for the expedition is a success, and Halil has been ransomed and returned to our Beylik."
 Ottomans.008.a: "Surely good news for Orhan"
 Ottomans.009.t: "Results of the Expedition"
 Ottomans.009.d: "It seems we have upheld our end of the deal, for the expedition to retrieve Halil was a complete success. Halil is now in our hands, due for the first ship across the Bosphorus, and forever in our debt. If he can win the succession for the Ottoman throne, we may have a chance at peace after all."
 Ottomans.009.a: "Let us pray for his fortune"
 Ottomans.009.b: "We can do more than pray"
 Ottomans.010.t: "Successful Expedition"
 Ottomans.010.d: "Our decision to use the Rumeli has paid off, for Halil is home safe and the Rumeli successful afterall. Halil returns to us, meak yet alive."
 Ottomans.010.a: "Our dynasty is secure"
 Ottomans.011.t: "Successful Expedition"
 Ottomans.011.d: "Our decision to use the Rumeli has paid off, for Halil is home safe and the Rumeli successful afterall. Halil returns to us, proud and seemingly transformed by the ordeal."
 Ottomans.011.a: "Truly Orhan's son..."
 Ottomans.012.t: "Halil's Gambit"
 Ottomans.012.d: "In a shocking turn of events, the once kidnapped prince has become a contender for the throne, rallying his supporters, fresh with resources and declaring his intentions for rule of the Beylik. We must look to our defences now, for this pretender threatens all Orhan has worked for."
 Ottomans.012.a: "One way or another, we will prevail"
 Ottomans.013.t: "Halil's Gambit"
 Ottomans.013.d: "In a predictable and failed attempt for the throne, Halil has been captured by loyalist after seeking our supporters amongst our top generals. Our loyalists present him to us, ready for execution."
 Ottomans.013.a: "Was that even an attempt? Off with his head."
 Ottomans.014.t: "Halil's Victory"
 Ottomans.014.d: "In a move that will surely please our Rumeli friends, Sehzade Halil, the true son of Orhan has defeated Murad and claimed the throne. We have sent envoys to the Romans announcing our rule, as we instead turn to Anatolian matters."
 Ottomans.014.a: "Peace in the Bosphorus will reign"
 Ottomans.015.t: "Halil's Victory"
 Ottomans.015.d: "Our longshot gamble has paid off, for Halil is victorious, already sending envoy's announcing his reign and his lack of intentions. We now have time, and a free hand without fear of invasion for now."
 Ottomans.015.a: "Let us make the most of this peace."
 Ottomans.016.t: "War for Thrace"
 Ottomans.016.d: "Years of raiding has left the Rumeli weak, trusting their forts more than their men and leaving their lands ripe for the taking. Our forces are ready, the generals eager, the Ghazi pray, and all expect the inevitable. Is it time?"
 Ottomans.016.a: "Onward, to Europe"
 Ottomans.016.b: "It is not time"
 Ottomans.017.t: "The Janissaries"
 Ottomans.017.d: "As our Beylik enters a new phase of expansion and consolidation, our experienced and veteran tribal host has been taking new forms and a new identity. This emergent synthesis between Rumeli recruitment and our Turk traditions has led to great numbers of volunteers and conscripts alike entering a new force, enduring rigorous training to ensure they are prepared to face the infidels and beyond."
 Ottomans.017.a: "Our realm grows stronger by the day..."
 Ottomans.018.t: "An offer for peace."
 Ottomans.018.d: "We have recieved an offer for surrender from the Turks. Should we accept, we will cede all of our holdings outisde of Thrace and Thessalonike to the Turks, becoming their feudatory hereforth. Given our present situation, we may not have much choice. Already the starving peasants in the capital are demanding an end to the war. Refusal may mean unrest in the capital and elsewhere."
 Ottomans.018.a: "We have no choice, give the emissary our offer of surrender."
 Ottomans.018.b: "Never! [From.GetName] will not fall so long as I live!"
 Ottomans.019.t: "The Rumeli have Surrendered!"
 Ottomans.019.d: "Seeing that their situation was hopeless, the Rumeli have offered to cede considerable lands to us!"
 Ottomans.019.a: "Wonderful!"
 Ottomans.019.b: "We will not rest until we have the city of the world's desire!"
 Ottomans.020.t: "The Rumeli have refused!"
 Ottomans.020.d: "The Rumeli cling to the idea that something will save them, and have refused the terms we have offered them."
 Ottomans.020.a: "Those walls will not protect them forever, they will feel the pain of an extended siege."
 Ottomans.021.t: "The Turks have refused!"
 Ottomans.021.d: "Despite our generous offer of land, the Turks have refused.  We will hold on until the end!"
 Ottomans.021.a: "Roma invicta!"
 Ottomans.022.t: "A Cruel Reality"
 Ottomans.022.d: "Despite our best attempts, the reality of our situation has not changed. We are alone, and we are out of time. We have one chance to surrender before our final twilight is found, to reason with the Turks and offer them our hand as their new vassal. Is this the end of the Empire?"
 Ottomans.022.a: "Accept reality, offer them our submission..."
 Ottomans.022.b: "We will fight on our own terms."
 Ottomans.023.t: "Roman Submission"
 Ottomans.023.d: "It appears the Rumeli have shown true capacity for reason, as they have offered us their submission as somewhat autonomous vassal. This may provide us with sufficient peace at home to launch new campaigns abroad. Shall we accept their reasonable offer?"
 Ottomans.023.a: "Vassalage is an ideal arrangement"
 Ottomans.023.b: "No truce, their time has come."
 Ottomans.024.t: "Honor in Defeat"
 Ottomans.024.d: "Peace has come, for the Turks have accepted our terms. Hereforth we will be a vassal of the Ottomans, our security guaranteed once more. For now, our dreams of Roma Invicta will come to an end."
 Ottomans.024.a: "A sad day for our people."
 Ottomans.025.t: "The Turks Refuse"
 Ottomans.025.d: "The worst news has come to our gates, for the Turks have refused our treaty. Our final stand is nigh, the fate of Rome to be decided forever more."
 Ottomans.025.a: "God help us..."
 Ottomans.026.t: "Burden of Vassalage"
 Ottomans.026.d: "Decades of peace has not been without its struggles, with annual tribute and the limits of our autonomy leaving our state weakened and dependent. These years of struggle have now culminated with a turn in our relations with the Ottomans for the worst, providing a rare opportunity for defiance. If we so desire, we could use the situation to revoke our oath of vassalage, and become free and independent once more. The Ottomans may not immediately respond, yet our punishment will likely be in short due."
 Ottomans.026.a: "Our subservience ends today"
 Ottomans.026.b: "This situation works in our favor"
 Ottomans.027.t: "The Impetuous Rumeli"
 Ottomans.027.d: "Peace at home has come at the cost of dealing with the infidels at our door, denying us lands that rightfully belong to the Sultanate of Rum. Recently relations have taken a turn for the worse, and left us in doubt of the benefits of our relationship. An opportunity therefore has arisen, a chance to use the situation to revoke our offer of protection, and end their vassalage if we so desire."
 Ottomans.027.a: "Their oaths are of no use any longer."
 Ottomans.027.b: "The current situation is ideal."
 Ottomans.028.t: "Disunity in the West"
 Ottomans.028.d: "As our borders expand and our dominion grows greater, the opportunities for conquest have presented themselves. Our neighbors have split into smaller principalities, feuding over the remains of their empire. With a single strike, we could begin a war to conquer what's left of their domain."
 Ottomans.028.a: "War has come"
 Ottomans.028.b: "Not now"
 Ottomans.029.t: "A Professional Army"
 Ottomans.029.d: "What was once the tribal host that fought for a rising Beylik is now a professional force that all should envy, and our enemies fear. The Janissaries stand as a testament to our strength, a new force that will raise our growing dominion to newfound heights."
 Ottomans.029.a: "Our ascendance is near..."
