 flavor_hab.1010.title:1 "The Tyrolian Heir dies"
 flavor_hab.1010.desc:1 "My $MONARCHTITLE$, sad news have reached us: $HEIR$, your heir, has died. Without an heir, the succession is contentious. We are related to the Habsburgs in Austria, who now claim that you should transfer your rule to one of their dynasty. We could give in to their demands, but that would give other rulers of our dynasty a pretence to invade our lands. On the other hand, not giving in to their demands will surely provoke a violent response from the Habsburgs."
 flavor_hab.1010.a:1 "Sign off our land to the Habsburgs."
 flavor_hab.1010.b:1 "We should keep our lands in our dynasty."
 flavor_hab.1011.title:1 "The Loss of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Habsburg Family"
 flavor_hab.1011.desc:1 "$COUNTRY$ has traditionally been part of the Austrian Domains which are indivisible as proclaimed in the Georgenberg Pact. Now $COUNTRY$ is no longer ruled by the Habsburgs, de facto dividing the Austrian Domains. Diplomats from Vienna have already arrived with demands to give them our lands. Their claims are justified and clear; dismissing them would surely end in hostilities."
 flavor_hab.1011.a:1 "Give the land back to the Habsburgs."
 flavor_hab.1011.b:1 "My family inherited this land, and we shall keep it!"
 flavor_hab.1012.title:1 "Reclaimed Habsburg lands"
 flavor_hab.1012.desc:1 "After the loss of the Habsburg dynasty in $FROM$, their ruler, [From.Monarch.GetName], has decided to give in and give back his and to its rightful owners - us."
 flavor_hab.1012.a:1 "Fantastic!"
 flavor_hab.1012.b:1 "What? We don't want that!"
 flavor_hab.1013.title:1 "No Habsburgs in $FROM$"
 flavor_hab.1013.desc:1 "The lands of $FROM$ have been an integral part of the Austrian Domains for a long time now, but with a non-Habsburg ruling it, Austria has been de facto divided. Still $FROM$'s ruler [From.Monarch.GetName] refuses to transfer their Lands to us. We must reclaim them!"
 flavor_hab.1013.a:1 "The nerve of that [Root.Monarch.GetWomanMan]!"
 flavor_hab.1013.b:1 "We don't want that anyway."
 flavor_hab.1014.title:1 "Pressure from Vienna"
 flavor_hab.1014.desc:1 "Theoretically, the Austrian Domains were one. Still, different parts of Austria were ruled by different monarchs. Now that our king has died, there has been a lot of intrigue and scheming in Vienna. It might result in our lands being ruled by another."
 flavor_hab.1014.a:1 "Damn!"
 flavor_hab.1015.title:1 "Unification of the Austrian Domains"
 flavor_hab.1015.desc:1 "Theoretically, the Austrian Domains were one. Still, different parts of Austria were ruled by different monarchs. $FROM$'s monarch has recently died, and court intrigue and scheming has resulted in us being in a position to seize $FROM$ as well!"
 flavor_hab.1015.a:1 "Very Good!"
 flavor_hab.1015.b:1 "Transfer it to the old heir anyway."
 flavor_hab.1016.title:1 "Pressure from the Local Nobles"
 flavor_hab.1016.desc:1 "My $MONARCHTITLE$, the nobles of Tyrol have met and are now demanding for you to give up your throne to another Habsburg ruler! They cite your disastrous war, debt and the loss of trade opportunities and income as delegitimising your rule. Surely if we refuse, they will rise up to achieve a favourable situation for them anyway!"
 flavor_hab.1016.a:1 "Give in to the demands."
 flavor_hab.1016.b:1 "I rule this land!"
 flavor_hab.1017.title:1 "Transferred Rule from Tyrol"
 flavor_hab.1017.desc:1 "Our relatives in Tyrol are currently embroiled in a lost war. The general destabilisation that comes with that has led to the local nobles demanding to transfer [From.Monarch.GetName]'s rule to us, and he has accepted."
 flavor_hab.1017.a:1 "Good!"
 flavor_hab.1017.b:1 "Give it back."
 
 flavor_hab.ct.1:1 "Sad news has reached us: $HEIR$, your heir, has died. Without an heir, the succession is contentious.

We could give in to their demands, but that would give other rulers of our dynasty a pretence to invade our lands.

 flavor_hab.ct.2:1 "Since we have no heir, the succession of your title has been a hotly debated topic. We are related to the Habsburgs in Austria, who now claim that you should transfer your rule to one of their dynasty. We could give in to their demands, but that would give other rulers of our dynasty a pretence to invade our lands. On the other hand, not giving in to their demands will surely provoke a violent response from the Habsburgs."
