 flavor_pol.604.title:1 "Union of Lublin"
 flavor_pol.604.desc:1 "The Union of Lublin was signed 1 July 1569, in Lublin, Poland, and created a single state, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. It replaced the personal union of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania with a real union and an elective monarchy, since Sigismund II Augustus, the last of the Jagiellons, remained childless after three marriages. In addition, the autonomy of Royal Prussia was largely abandoned. The Duchy of Livonia, tied to Lithuania in real union since the Union of Grodno (1566), became a Polish–Lithuanian condominium.\n\n The Commonwealth was ruled by a single elected monarch who carried out the duties of King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, and governed with a common Senate and parliament (the Sejm). The Union was an evolutionary stage in the Polish–Lithuanian alliance and personal union, also necessitated by Lithuania's dangerous position in wars with Russia.\n\nConstituting a crucial event in the history of several nations, the Union of Lublin has been viewed quite differently by many historians. Sometimes identified as the moment at which the Szlachta (including Lithuanians/Ruthenians) rose to the height of their power, establishing a democracy of noblemen as opposed to absolute monarchy. Some historians concentrate on its positive aspects, emphasising its peaceful, voluntary creation, inclusive character and its role in spreading of economical welfare and good laws; other see there a possible cause of social and political instability that led to the Partitions of Poland about 200 years later. Some Lithuanian historians are more critical of the Union, pointing out that it was an effect of domination by Polish nobles."

Thus the Order sought opportunities to undo the Polish–Lithuanian union; they demanded Samogitia, a section of western Lithuania that bordered the Baltic Sea, and refused to recognize Grand Duke's baptism in 1386.

 flavor_teu.EVTDESC1:0 "Despite our best efforts we have been unable to curtail the Prussian Confederation's efforts to undermine [Root.GetAdjective] rule. The cities that pledged their support to the Confederation have rallied an army and have risen up in open revolt. As we suspected, many of its members have ties to Poland and have already requested Polish intervention in the coming conflict. It seems that a bloody struggle in Prussia is unavoidable unless we renounce our rule over these cities."

 flavor_pol.750.title: "End of the Cossack Rebellion"
 flavor_pol.750.desc: "The Cossack Rebellion proved to be disastrous for our country. Within a few months almost all Polish nobles, officials and priests had been wiped out or driven from the lands of Ukraine. Polish population losses in the uprising were very significant. In addition, Jews suffered substantial losses because they were the most numerous and accessible representatives of the Szlachta. Neverthless order in Ukraine has been finally restored, and our nation can once again enter the period of internal peace. At least for now."
 flavor_pol.750.a: "God will judge the traitors."
 
 flavor_pol.760.title: "Svitrigaila Asks for Our Support"
 flavor_pol.760.desc: "Svitrigaila from the house of Gediminai, cousin of King of Poland [POL.Monarch.GetName] and Grand Duke of Lithuania [LIT.Monarch.GetName] has just arrived at our capital in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]. Recent Treaty of Ostrow signed betweeen [POL.Monarch.GetName] and [LIT.Monarch.GetName] essentialy crushed Svitrigaila's lifelong ambition to one day become the Grand Duke of Lithuania. Disguised as a merchant he fleed Lithuania, travelled all the way to Prussia and now he's asking for our support in a rebellion against his rightful overlords. What should we do?"
 flavor_pol.760.a: "Support him by any means necessary!"
 flavor_pol.760.b: "We have no interest in meddling with Lithuanian affairs"
 
 flavor_pol.761.title: "Svitrigaila's Rebellion"
 flavor_pol.761.desc: "Svitrigaila was born to Algirdas, Grand Duke of Lithuania, and his second wife Uliana of Tver. His date of birth is unknown, but it is believed that he was the youngest or second youngest son of Algirdas. Recent Treaty of Ostrow signed betweeen [POL.Monarch.GetName] and [LIT.Monarch.GetName] essentialy crushed Svitrigaila's lifelong ambition to one day become the Grand Duke of Lithuania. In response he fleed Lithuania and disguised as a merchant travelled all the way to Prussia to seek support among Teutonic Knights. Svitrigaila has eventually returned to his homeland, launching an open revolt against Gran Duke [LIT.Monarch.GetName]."
 flavor_pol.761.a: "Can't one event trust in his own family?"
 
 flavor_pol.763.title: "Svitrigaila is Defeated"
 flavor_pol.763.desc: "With his armies defeated on the battlefield Svitragaila lost any hopes to succeed in an open rebellion against [LIT.Monarch.GetName]. He was eventually captured and sent to Kraków to hear our judgement. From one hand he's a traitor, from the other he's still a member of our family and his death could anger many of Lithuanian boyars. What should we do with him?"
 flavor_pol.763.a: "Pardon him his devious crimes."
 flavor_pol.763.b: "No mercy for traitors!"
 
 flavor_pol.764.title: "Svitrigaila Rebels Again"
 flavor_pol.764.desc: "Upon death of previous Grand Duke of Lithuania, some of Lithuanian boyars unilaterally elected Svitrigaila as their new Grand Duke. This violated the terms of the Union of Horodło, where Lithuanians promised not to elect a new Grand Duke without the approval of the Kingdom of Poland. The Polish nobility, led by bishop of Krakow, were outraged and demanded that Svitrigaila acknowledged his fealty to the Crown of Poland. Lithuania was eventually divided into two camps: supporters of the King of Poland and his cousin Sigismund Kestutatis to the west, and supporters of Svitrigaila to the east. Yet another civil war in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania seems to be inevitable."
 flavor_pol.764.a: "We should have forseen this."
 
 flavor_pol.766.title: "Svitrigaila is Once Again Defeated"
 flavor_pol.766.desc: "With his armies defeated on the battlefield Svitragaila is once again defeated by the loyalist forces led by Sigismund Kestutatis. After the defeat, Svitrigaila fled to Polotsk. Losing his influence in the Slavic principalities, he attempted to reconcile with Poland: he would rule the Ruthenian lands that still supported him and after his death the territories would pass to the King of Poland. However, Polish Senate did not ratify this treaty under strong protest from Sigismund. Svitrigaila eventually retreated to Wallachia in [GetYear]."
 flavor_pol.766.a: "Sigismund Kestutatis shall be confirmed as Grand Duke of Lithuania!"
 
 flavor_pol.767.title: "Election in Lithuania"
 flavor_pol.767.desc: "In his last will our previous monarch stipulated that Poland and Lithuania would be ruled by two of his sons separately. This decision was furtherly reinforced by the recent Union of Krakow and Vilnius. Lithuanian boyars had already elected one of our previus monarch sons as their new Grand Duke. While this may mean an end to the Polish-Lithuanian Union these two realms are going to remain close allies, willing to die for each other if necessary. One day the Polish-Lithuanian Union may be once again restored."

 flavor_teu.EVTDESC2:0 "An organization calling itself the Prussian Confederation has risen up against the injustices of Teutonic rule, and have rallied an army in Danzig. We have previously given its members quiet assurances that we would support their cause should it come to open war. In exchange, the Confederation has agreed that the Prussian lands should be ruled by Poland after the tyrannical Knights have been expelled. We have much to gain from this arrangement, but we should be prepared for a bloody struggle."
 flavor_pol.752.a:0 "They shall have our full support. To battle!"
 flavor_pol.752.b:0 "This is no business of ours."
 flavor_teu.EVTDESC4:0 "The Teutonic Order finds itself plagued with unrest and conspiracy. A new organization has appeared to challenge Teutonic rule, despite our recent outing of the Lizard League which sought to invite Poland to rule Kulm. Calling themselves the Prussian Confederation this union of burghers, knights, and noblemen declare that their purpose is to unite against injustice and arbitrary rule. If this treason were not enough, it is known that many among their number have Polish sympathies, and like their predecessors might attempt to invite Polish rule over Prussia if their influence is not curtailed. Worryingly, they have already found significant support among the burghers of West Prussia."
 flavor_pol.753.a:0 "We must curtail these traitors."

We have to regain control over lost lands, war seems to be inevitable."

 flavor_teu.6.title: "The Last Grand Master of Teutonic Order"
 flavor_teu.6.desc: "$MONARCH$, grand master of the Teutonic Order, died in [GetYear]. Albrecht was chosen as his successor in the hope that his relationship to his maternal uncle, Grand Duke of Lithuania and king of Poland, would facilitate a settlement of the disputes over eastern Prussia, which had been held by the order under Polish suzerainty since the Second Peace of Thorn. Meanwhile the reformist movement in Western Europe is growing in strength. Some suggest that new grand master should abandon the rules of his order, marry, and convert Prussia into a hereditary duchy for himself."
 
 flavor_teu.7.title: "Insanity of the Duke"
 flavor_teu.7.desc: "In [GetYear] $MONARCH$ began to exhibit signs of mental disorder. Though not necessarily dominated by them, episodes of delusion, hallucination and incoherence are frequent enough and visible enough to make others inherently question his capacity tu rule over the Duchy of Prussia."
 flavor_teu.7.a: "Perhaps it's a time to replace him?"
 
 flavor_teu.8.title: "Succession in the Duchy of Prussia"
 flavor_teu.8.desc: "With the succession in the Duchy of Prussia being uncertain, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] $MONARCH$ has decided to pass his hereditary rights to the Duchy onto his cousin in the Holy Roman Empire. With our overlord in [Root.Overlord.GetName] facing its own internal and external problems this could be a chance to once again restore Prussia to its former glory. One day the time may even come when together with our new allies we'll finally be able to retake Royal Prussia and eventually take our revenge on our eternal enemies from [Root.Overlord.GetName]."
 flavor_teu.8.a: "Let's send word to the Holy Roman Empire!"
 
 flavor_teu.9.title: "Succession in the Duchy of Prussia"
 flavor_teu.9.desc: "Succession in the Duchy of Prussia is on a knife edge. With almost certain extinction of Prussian ruling dynasty it's up to [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] $MONARCH$ to succeed in the Duchy. With [From.Overlord.GetName] being busy with their own internal and external problems they may not be ready to successfuly intervene and thwart our dynastic plans. War of the Prussian Succession remains a real threat and we cannot be sure about the stance of the Holy Roman Emperor. Are we ready to risk a war over the Duchy of Prussia?"
 flavor_teu.9.a: "We shall succeed in the Duchy of Prussia!"
 flavor_teu.9.b: "We can't risk a war over Prussia"
 
 flavor_teu.11.title: "Succession in the Duchy of Prussia"
 flavor_teu.11.desc: "Our unruly vassal in the Duchy of Prussia has decided to pass his hereditary rights to its lands onto his cousin [From.Monarch.GetName], ruler of [From.GetName]. It is an obvious violation of a feudal contract, since in accordance with all known laws it should be up to [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] $MONARCH$ to decide the fate of Prussia. With our country severely weakened by internal and external struggles we may not be ready for intervention, which may eventually lead to a war against [From.GetName] and its protectors in the Holy Roman Empire. If we don't decide to intervene, letting [From.Monarch.GetName] to succeed in Prussia, he and his successors probably won't be able to pose any threat anyway. Won't they...?"
 flavor_teu.11.opt.a: "It's outrageous! We should intervene."
