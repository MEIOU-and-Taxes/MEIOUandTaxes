 tianxia.43.d:1 "We assert our dominance over the people of the plains. Never again shall we be subservient to Han or Mongols!

However our newly restored Tang dynasty wasn't strong enough and a new leader rose, Shi Jingtang, who declared rise of Jin dynasty.

 tianxia.135.d:1 "The [From.Monarch.GetTitle] at [From.Capital.GetCapitalName] has heard of the disturbance in our princedom. Angry that Imperial blood was spilled and his kin is fighting over power, he ordered every descendant of Prince of [From.Tag.GetName] stripped of Imperial status, stipend and titles.\n\n Unless we want to defy him and occupy [From.Capital.GetCapitalName] we have to do his bidding."

 tianxia.140.d:1 "The Imperial Palace in [Root.Overlord.Capital.GetCapitalName] was usurped not by a scion of the Imperial [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] family, but a lowly bastard [Root.Overlord.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] [Root.Overlord.Monarch.GetName]! Proclaiming a new [Root.Overlord.Tag.GetName] Dynasty he claims to have received the Mandate of Heaven and demands loyalty from all the former subjects of our dynasty.\n\nFor the survival of our legacy we have to take down the usurper!"

 China_LoyalistMod:1 "Long United, Must Divide"
 China_LoyalistMod_desc:1 "The Middle Kingdom has collapsed, divided amongst rebels and distrustful loyalists. We are of the later kind, finding our origins as a decentralised division of the Kingdom, sanctioned by the Emperor. Even as our loyalties fade and we forge our own destiny, the people have not forgotten the divisive policies of the Emperors before, nor our ties to the old Kingdom. We must restore legitimacy to our rule, and unite China under our banner."
 China_RebelMod:1 "Long United, Must Divide"
 China_RebelMod_desc:1 "The Middle Kingdom has collapsed, divided amongst rebels and distrustful loyalists. We are of the former, righteous in our cause and clear in vision. The Emperor must fall, the old Kingdom must be swept away and China united under our divinely ordained cause. The people are behind us, loyal to our cause, yet the elites are distrustful, wary of our grandious plans. For we know of one truth, China must be united once more, and the Mandate restored under a new order."
