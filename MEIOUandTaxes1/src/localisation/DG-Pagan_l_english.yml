 DG_Hellenic.001.title: "$MONARCH$ Poses a Question to the Oracle."
 DG_Hellenic.001.desc: "Our ruler has visited the Oracle in search of advice.  Oracles would consult the signs and then provide an answer to the question asked, although it often came in the form of cryptic advice that needed interpretation before it could be acted upon.  Wise rulers sought the advice of the oracles, but did not always act upon it.  Due to bad advice or the person's faulty interpretation of it, following their advice could sometimes lead to disaster, which led to a decline in their popularity over time."

 DG_Hellenic.004.title: "Hellenistic Philosophies"
 DG_Hellenic.004.desc: "Three competing philosophies were developed during the golden age of Hellenism, and each had a profound and lasting impact on the politics of Greek nations for centuries to come.  Epicurianism promoted the idea that people should avoid things which cause fear or pain, including indulging in excess.  As a result, Epicurians tended to live quiet lives far away from politics.  Stoicism taught that achieving virtue was the most important thing in life, and that having virtue was more important than being happy.  Stoics believed they had a duty to help others, and that they should manage to do their duty despite pain or suffering.  Finally, Cynicism demanded complete honesty, both in their personal lives and in politics.  Cynics were famous for openly and frequently criticising government and religion in their search for truth.  While these philosophies coexisted, the one espoused by the $MONARCHTITLE$ had greater impact."

 DG_Hellenic.007.desc: "$PHILOSOPHER$ was a gifted but eccentric man.  He taught and wrote philosophy, astronomy, history and geography, compiling digests of many classical writers.  The more he studied the classics, the more enthusiastic he became about them.  In $YEAR$ he wrote several pamphlets to [Root.Monarch.GetName] describing how [Root.GetName] could be reorganised according to Plato's Republic, with political, legal and economic reforms that would leave the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] as a centralised monarch, the army made up of professional citizen-soldiers, and the peasants working land owned by the state.\n\nWhen invited to attend a Church council, he began teaching scholars about the Greek classics, especially the work of Plato, which inspired a renewed interest in the Greek classics.  Finally, in his personal life he was moral but also polytheistic, encouraging his pupils to pray to statues of the gods of Rome and Greece.  This did not help him defend against charges of heresy."

Athletes and spectators journeyed to the games from across the Hellenic world, not only to take part in the games and rituals, but also to form alliances and broker deals with the powerful individuals who came to watch the games.

Despite a ban on cash prizes, many athletes became rich from the games.  The games were a competition of city-state against city-state, and noble against noble.  Rich and powerful men would sponsor athletes, raise teams of horses and pay for the food and lodging of their athletes.  Cities found ways to indirectly reward winners, granting them free meals for life, political appointments, free theatre tickets, and even exemptions from taxation.  In addition, winners would be lauded in songs, poems, and even statues built at public expense."

All this fostered a culture of competition, both among the athletes (who were known to pray for victory or death) and among the sponsors of the games, who found ways to send more promising athletes to the games.\n\nAt times these efforts resulted in scandals that tainted not only the athletes and their sponsors, but the games themselves.  Rulers and other powerful men could use their wealth to suborn rivals; it was not unheard of for wrestlers to kill their opponents, even though this was banned; events could be cancelled rather than allow openly gay athletes to participate; grown men could be entered into boy's competitions.  The list goes on and on - and each time, it shocked the crowds, nobles and priests who oversaw the games.\n\nTraditionally, the punishment for this kind of behaviour was paying a fine which was used to pay for the statues to the gods that lined the arenas."

Captured men would be given play weapons and attacked by four soldiers.  When they inevitably succumbed to exhaustion, they would be taken to the altar, where a priest would ritually slaughter them, letting their blood drain down the temple.  A single important ritual could sacrifice tens of thousands over the course of several days.  In so doing, they hoped to bring the favour of the gods.  One of the most important aspects of the ritual was to force vassals and defeated enemies to watch, helpless, as their loyal men were sacrificed one by one in front of them.  The rulers would then be released to rule in the name of the $MONARCHTITLE$, having seen their power firsthand.\n\nA greater sacrifice brings greater rewards.  We capture more prisoners every time we win a battle, so having an enemy we can fight often is a good strategy."

The accused had a week to respond to the challenge, and if he failed to show up would be marked as an honorless outcast.  At first the duels were to the death, with the winner claiming the loser's possessions.

The $MONARCHTITLE$ led the nation in nine days of sacrifices, in which nine of each living creature were sacrificed, one per day.  This included not only the traditional horse and oxen, but also birds, small animals, and even men.  The names of nine men were read out loud before the blot began.
