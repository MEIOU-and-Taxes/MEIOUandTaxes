 kalmar.001.t:1 "A Marriage for the $MONARCHTITLE$"
 kalmar.001.d:1 "The $MONARCHTITLE$ is in need of a bride, there are two choices. Either a marriage between the $MONARCHTITLE$ and a local noble to strengthen the hold on Norway or arrange a marriage between the daughter of [DEN.Monarch.GetTitle] [DEN.Monarch.GetName] and the $MONARCHTITLE$. Such a union would strengthen our relations with the Kingdom of Denmark."
 kalmar.001.a:1 "Arrange a Marriage with the [DEN.Monarch.GetTitle] of the Danes' daughter"
 kalmar.001.b:1 "Arrange a Marriage with a local"
 kalmar.002.t:1 "An offer from the Norwegian [From.Monarch.GetTitle]"
 kalmar.002.d:1 "The [From.Monarch.GetTitle] of Norway has proposed a marriage between your youngest daughter Margrethe. The match will secure a firmer relation between the two nations, furthermore the grandson of the $MONARCHTITLE$ will rule Norway."
 kalmar.002.a:1 "Accept the offer"
 kalmar.002.b:1 "Decline the offer"
 kalmar.003.t:1 "Grievous News"
 kalmar.003.d:1 "Due to unforeseen circumstances the heir is dead. The $MONARCHTITLE$ has no more sons. A decision needs to be taken, Denmark cannot survive another interregnum like the one from 1332-1340."

 kalmar.004.t:1 "A new heir"
 kalmar.004.d:1 "The two daughters of the $MONARCHTITLE$. Ingeborg and Margrethe both have sons that can be suitable heirs to the Danish Throne. Albrecht, son of Ingeborg, is the third in line to the throne of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. Oluf, son of Margrethe, is the eldest son of the King of Norway. We have to make a decision; a personal union with a powerful German duchy or a personal union with the Kingdom of Norway, which surely Denmark will dominate, being the richer of the two. Unfortunate both decisions will result in the end of the Estrid dynasty. The Danish dynasty which illustrious kings such as Knut the Great, Valdemar the Great, Valdemar the Victorious and Svend Forkbeard hails from."

Most especially the Danes will remember him as the King that brought Denmark back from the ruins of the 12 year interregnum where German counts ruled Denmark. His heir and Grandson Oluf is too young to rule immediately. His mother the youngest daughter of Valdemar will be his regent."

 kalmar.006.t:1 "The $MONARCHTITLE$ is sick!"

 kalmar.006.a:1 "We will pray that the $MONARCHTITLE$ survives this illness"
 kalmar.007.t:1 "The death of Oluf"
 kalmar.007.d:1 "In 1387 Oluf the king of Norway and Denmark died at 17 years old, leaving his mother Margrethe as the regent of both countries. The exact reason for his death is unknown. However, to stay regent and effective ruler of Denmark, for a long time it was believed that Margrethe herself ordered the death of her own son. Margrethe profited from Oluf's death as she was elected regent of Norway too. With his death, the Swedish Bjelbo dynasty died out. The important Bjelbo dynasty were crucial in the formation of the Swedish Kingdom. Birger Jarl (1200-1266) is attributed to have founded the capital Stockholm and played a pivotal role in the consolidation of Sweden. He was one of just many prominent members of the Bjelbo dynasty."

 kalmar.010.d:1 "The Swedish nobles were tired of Magnus' rule, something which earlier had led to civil war between father and son. In 1365, it led to the disposal of Magnus. Albrecht of Mecklenburg, the nephew of Magnus, was offered the Swedish throne by the Swedish nobleman Bo Jonsson Grip, which he accepted."

 kalmar.012.t:1 "A Solution"
 kalmar.012.d:1 "Albrecht of Mecklenburg is not the king we had hoped him to be; we have had a good record of disposing unwanted kings and are capable of doing it again. To the southwest Margrethe is ruling both Denmark and Norway as regent, we could offer her the throne. Surely she will let us rule our self without interfering."

 kalmar.015.d:1 "In 1397 nobles from Denmark, Sweden and Norway gathered in the Swedish Kalmar Castle, in the province of Småland. Here the three kingdoms were joined under a single monarch. This included the holdings of Finland and the Norwegian Atlantic isles. The land area, that Margrethe I came to rule, was as large as 3.000.000 square kilometres. The union was a response to continues German northward expansion into the Baltic region, especially the Hanseatic League. Ironically, the Danish dynasty Estrid and the Swedish Bjelbo dynasty both died out before the formation of the Kalmar Union. It would be a set of German dynasties that would try to keep union together against continuous internal strife. The three kingdoms would continue to rule themselves, though Denmark as the most powerful kingdom would try to assert its influence over the two other kingdoms. The five most important principals were written down in the Union letter as such: One King shall rule over all three kingdoms. In principle the Union shall be an elective monarchy, but royal son shall be elected. The King shall rule every kingdom according to their laws. If one Kingdom is threatened by war, the others will then come and help. A person judged lawless, will also be lawless in the other kingdoms. At negotiations the king, and his councillors from each kingdom, have the right to take decisions for all kingdoms."
