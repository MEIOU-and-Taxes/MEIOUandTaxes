 CaHAversion.1000.d: "Willem IV of Holland had taken many loans from the Urban elite, these together with Willem V lavish lifestyle provided for by the elites had strained the relationship between the count and his urban subjects. With the old royal family deposed they now hold the rural elites, and his majesty liable. Having regained their trust they are willing to work towards a resolution of the conflict. Your advisors suggest three solutions.\n\nWe could pay the loans back in full, whilst expensive it would show we are serious about our obligations and can be trusted in further dealings. Though the rural elite might see this as a betrayal.\n\nWe could give the urban elite privalages and tax breaks as reward for their patience, cheaper, and whilst not upsetting the rural elite as much later taking away said privalages later on will doubtless give us other problems, if possible at all.\n\nWIP Lastly we could 'encourage' the noble elite to pay their debts to the burghers. This will likely upset both parties as they are unlikely to pay timely and in full but will ease tensions and redirect their displeasure to the state intead of each other."
