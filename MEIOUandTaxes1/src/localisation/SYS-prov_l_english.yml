 POP_Census.110.t: "Burden of Taxation"
 POP_Census.110.d: "The complex task of extracting resources from the realm is one with great cost for our central government. High taxation levels cost disproportionately more Administrative, Diplomatic and Military Power to uphold, while simple economics of scale in a larger realm can leave our efforts more scattered and constrained.\n\nThe values listed within the options below have been extracted in a yearly lump sum from our saved pool to support provincial taxation. Generally, an allocation of around 10~15 Power for each category is considered 'average' taxation, with levels above or below this amount exchanging more or less Power for varying levels of resources. Revenue generated from each tax type can be seen in the Bureaucracy estate, or through cycling a given province's Provincial Administration modifier. Additionally, this event can be hidden away in the decision menu."

 POP_Census.895.name: "Tax Configurator"
 POP_Census.895.desc: "This tool will help you facilitate focused taxation and national tax adjustments. If you are looking to encourage growth in a part of your economy or a class of the society, you can abolish the taxes that are hampering their growth. Resources used to collect that disabled tax will go on to other taxes, allowing you to shape the economical landscape of the realm. Taxes that are enabled will be automatically redelegated to the most efficient taxation for the power spent. Remember, the way you actually decrease taxes is by lowering the power spent on them in the delegator.\n\nThese changes, like the delegator, will only take into effect the following January 1st date."
 Tax_Warning: "§YTaxes§! inherently cost resources, §YWages§! to pay administrators and bureaucrats and §YPower§! to maintain the vast networks required across the provinces. Each §YTax§! or §OObligation§! costs a different type of §YPower§! depending on their innate nature, varying as well based on various provincial factors and the §YTax Efficiency§! of the province."

 POP_Colonial.002.t:1 "Colonial Subsidies"
 POP_Colonial.002.d:1 "With colonial nations now established in our far off colonies, we can begin subsidising their administration using a portion of our own income. Without our support, the local colonies will suffer in their costly endeavours. Investment may be expensive, yet the potential returns could be worth the risks.\n\nSubsidies take one year to gather, and a full year to distribute. The effects become yearly within 2-3 years. This decision currently is irreversable."
 POP_Colonial.002.a:1 "Let us prepare to fund the colonies with 5% of our monthly income"

[Prov_Noble] expansion usually leads to the decline of freeholding, as the consolidation of holdings replaces small farms with powerful estates.\n\n[Prov_Noble] Power represents their control over the countryside, and in the absence of Burghers their expansion into urban centers. [Prov_Noble] property, feudal dues, local autonomy and the corruption of any bureaucracy will all rise in proportion to [Prov_Noble] power.\n\n[Prov_Noble] loyalty is heavily dependent on the respect and upholding of Hierarchy in any given province.

 Prov_UI.002.t: "Assess the Burghers"
 Prov_UI.002.d: "The burghers represent the wealthy urban elite, using their skills and assets to project power over urban centers. Their expansion provides a power-base for free trading and urban autonomy, but also the consolidation of production chains and the decline of small-business.\n\nBurgher Power represents their influence within urban centers. Burghers through rights can provide autonomous city governance proportionate to their power, providing local property taxes, excises and tolls, self-funding the city through tax revenue and projecting local autonomy.\n\nBurgher loyalty is dependent on the ruling power's respect for Consultation and Welfare. Actions promoting urban autonomy and commercial activity will please the burghers, while actions upholding the rural elite and urban centralisation will lead to disloyalty and hostility."

As the bureaucracy expands, the state can subsume roles traditionally taken by powerful elites, reforming administration as a whole in accordance with the state's will.\n\nBureaucracy Power represents the influence of the state within any given territory. As such, state taxes apply proportionate to power, and are sent to the central government proportionate to local autonomy. Any tax kept in the province by local autonomy will be sent into the local treasury.\n\nWhile the bureaucracy aims to serve the state, there remains capacity for the elites to co-opt the bureaucracy for their own interests. Corruption represents this takeover, and is generated per-elite proportionate to their power. Strong elites will corrupt local bureaucracy, siphoning wealth and lowering their own tax burden.

 Prov_UI.120.d: "The most important role of an evolving state is to take greater responsibility for the ongoing maintenance of constructed infrastructure. In the absence of the state, the Elites will fund infrastructure they feel will benefit their interests. In the absence of Elites, only the state can intervene to ensure the ongoing continuation of Infrastructure across the realm.\n\nInfrastructure can be highly expensive to maintain, and great care should be taken to ensure funding is secure for any ambitious state. In addition, higher levels of funding may not be possible without Centralisation government reform. (In the Future)"
 Prov_UI.400.t: "The State"
 Prov_UI.400.d: "If a realm is to transcend the old order, an alternative must be found, forged through generations of rulers and carried forth by loyal officials. This concept is the state, and its realisation is found through the creation of an empowered and effective administration across the entirety of the realm's domain.\n\nThe emergence of a state is no easy endeavour, as those loyal to the old order will resist every step of the way. Yet at the end of the path there is hope for a new realm, one built on principles of bureaucracy, meritocracy and universal law, a state that can realise the endless dreams of ambitious rulers and scheming officials. \n\n§RNote that this menu is only for reviewing Bureaucracy Reforms, you can not change them in this menu!§!"

 Prov_UI.081.d: "Any administration needs loyal servants, agents who can enact the will of government. Bureaucrats are the servants of the state, administering the realm, collecting taxes and organising armies.\n\nIf the Bureaucrats are to be successful, there are two crucial factors. Firstly, there must be enough staff employed to meet the needs of our tax system. Secondly, we must ensure they have sufficient pay to suceed in their duties, and avoid the temptation of finding other means of enrichment. Both of these factors have diminishing returns on Bureaucratic Effectiveness.\n\nAverage Effectiveness: [GV_Admin_EfficUni]%\nTotal Supply: [GV_Admin_SupplyUni] bureaucrats\nTotal Demand: [GV_Admin_DemandUni] bureaucrats"
