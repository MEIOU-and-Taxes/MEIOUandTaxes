 DG_Hindu.001.t:1 "A Favoured School"
 DG_Hindu.001.d:1 "All Hindus shared some beliefs, but not all worshipped the same gods or followed the same paths to enlightenment. Four different schools came to dominate Hinduism: Vaishnavists worshipped Vishnu as the only true god by emphasising 'bhakti', or selfless devotion. Shaivists worshipped Shiva and his family above the other gods, emphasising asceticism and rigorously following the scripture. Shaktists preferred Shakti, who they worshipped as Devi, the divine mother. This relatively new school emphasised the equality of the spiritual and material worlds, implicitly condoning both the occult and the pursuit of wealth. Finally, Smartists followed the belief that all Hindu gods were manifestations of the ultimate divine and each could, therefore, be worshipped or not as individuals desired."

 DG_Hindu.001.b:1 "The mysticism of Shiva the Destroyer"
 DG_Hindu.001.c:1 "The magic and power of mother Shakti is alluring"
 DG_Hindu.001.e:1 "All gods are manifestations of Brahman"
 DG_Hindu.002.t:1 "The Bhakti movement"
 DG_Hindu.002.d:1 "Devotion ('bhakti') is one of the forms of worship in Hinduism, emphasising purity of spirit and selfless service to the gods instead of ritual and philosophy.  Some men and women felt this selflessness so much that they travelled from village to village, sharing their feelings in song, dance and poetry.  These 'saints' could attract thousands of followers, transcending the caste system to speak to lower castes on their own level.  But precisely because of this, the movement drew the displeasure of the Brahmin priestly caste, who criticised the bhakti saints for being untrained and sometimes ignorant."

 DG_Hindu.002.b:1 "Support the Brahmin"
 DG_Hindu.002.c:1 "Stay removed from the situation"
 DG_Hindu.003.t:1 "The hermitage of $PROVINCENAME$"
 DG_Hindu.003.d:1 "Hindu holy men occasionally felt a desire to live in peace, harmony and seclusion amidst nature.  These hermitages grew into communities of ascetics who lived together in pursuit of spiritual enlightenment away from the corruption of the world.  They also filled valuable roles in society such as teaching young children.  There were two broad types of hermitages: Ashram, relatively informal religious communities, and Matha, hierarchal, rule-bound monasteries.  These communities were especially popular among more ascetic Hindus."
 DG_Hindu.003.a:1 "Allow an ashram to gather"
 DG_Hindu.003.b:1 "Encourage a matha to be built"
 DG_Hindu.004.t:1 "Tantrism"
 DG_Hindu.004.d:1 "Worshippers of the mother goddess Shakti were associated with older forms of goddess worship that were seen as occult and heretical.  This 'tantric' Hinduism practised a kind of taboo-breaking ritual (Aghori) that violated caste rules and Hindu law.  The most shocking practise was panchamakara, or 'five Ms', which involved the ritual consumption of meat, drinking of mead, and ritual orgies.  The latter practise could be seen on the walls and statues of Shaktist temples, much to the shock of conservative Hindus and heathens who came across them.  As shocking as it was, tantrism was also a compelling expression of freedom for a society in which caste was otherwise an unbreakable barrier between people."
 DG_Hindu.004.a:1 "Openly display our support"
 DG_Hindu.004.b:1 "Rein in the movement"
 DG_Hindu.005.t:1 "$PROVINCENAME$ becomes a centre of pilgrimage"
 DG_Hindu.005.d:1 "Pilgrimage to sacred places was an important part of Hinduism.  Pious worshippers would undertake lengthy trips to bathe in the river Ganges, pray at a sacred temple, or spend their dying days in the ancient city of Varanasi, all to appease the gods, carry out a vow, or simply show devotion.  Many temples responded to this pilgrimage by appealing to pilgrims with food and sacred prostitutes.  In return, these centres of pilgrimage ('tirtha') grew wealthy from this practise."
 DG_Hindu.005.a:1 "Condemn this commercialization"
 DG_Hindu.005.b:1 "Take our share of the proceeds"
 DG_Hindu.007.t:1 "Self-Immolation"
 DG_Hindu.007.d:1 "Tensions have risen as villagers report another case of forced sati - in which a widow is forced to kill herself.  Now the Brahmin look to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to restore order.\n\nHindu women sometimes followed a practise called 'sati' where they threw themselves onto the funeral pyre of their husband when he died, killing themselves in the process.  The practise was supposed to be voluntary but there was considerable pressure on widows to kill themselves or take holy vows and become a wandering Sadhvi rather than be a burden on society.  Since Hinduism taught that one's past life influenced one's present, some believed widows deserved the bad luck they had suffered and so shunned them.  Beginning with the Muslim invasions of India and the Bhakti movement, resistance to sati began to appear.  Hindu scripture (Vedas) contained mixed support for the practise, so in some Hindu nations sati was banned, while in others it was gradually replaced by a symbolic version in which the widow was declared dead publicly but continued to live in the village."
 DG_Hindu.007.a:1 "Encourage widows to become Sadhvis instead"
 DG_Hindu.007.b:1 "Encourage symbolic sati instead"
 DG_Hindu.007.c:1 "Ban the practise entirely"
 DG_Hindu.008.t:1 "The caste system"
 DG_Hindu.008.d:1 "The Muslim invasion of India caused a number of trends.  One was a growing disillusionment with the caste system (Varna) that pervaded Hindu society.  Mystics, theologians and philosophers such as the poet Annamacharya began speaking out against the caste system for not having scriptural support in the Vedas.  Instead, they proposed the equality of mankind.  Practises such as Bhakti and Tantrism provided outlets from the social friction of castes, but in some places, the system itself came under attack.  In some cases, rulers would choose to ignore caste in their court, although the caste system proved to outlast any single ruler."
 DG_Hindu.008.a:1 "Reinforce social structures"
 DG_Hindu.008.b:1 "Ignore these trends"
 DG_Hindu.008.c:1 "Dismantle the caste system"
 DG_Hindu.009.t:1 "Sankirtan movement"
 DG_Hindu.009.d:1 "The practise of kirtan, or call-and-response chanting, was developed in India between the twelfth and fifteenth centuries.  Unlike other forms of expression, kirtan involved the audience directly in responding to chants, singing or playing along with music, and even interacting in storytelling or acting.  Many of the most popular were 'san kirtan,' hymns of praise to the gods or religious messages in song.  People who might ordinarily not be involved with religion were exposed to its messages in a new and personal way and would even repeat them to others.  When a skilled poet like $ARTIST$ composed $COUNTRY_RELIGION$ kirtan in $PRIMARY_CULTURE$, the practise could spread like wildfire through a region.  In this way, the practise of sankirtan spread into other regions in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries."

 DG_Hindu.010.t:1 "Coronation of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]"
 DG_Hindu.010.d:1 "As is their duty and their right, Brahmin leaders stand ready to crown [Root.Monarch.GetName] as [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of [Root.GetName].  In exchange for this show of support, they are demanding that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] publicly acknowledge their superiority over [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] own caste, the Kshatriya.  Is it worth this humiliation?\n\nHindu history is one of conflict between the top two castes.  The Brahmin are the priests and intellectuals whose duty is to teach others about Hinduism - including the duties of each caste.  Naturally, Brahmin teaching reinforced the obligation to pay homage to the Brahmin.  The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and other nobles represent the Kshatriya warrior caste whose duty is to protect others, enforce the law and pay tribute to the Brahmin.  This made even the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] inferior to the priests - but who is really in charge?"
 DG_Hindu.010.a:1 "Acknowledge the superiority of the Brahmin"
 DG_Hindu.010.b:1 "The first duty of the Brahmin is to obey the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]"
 DG_Hindu.021.t:1 "The Sage of $PROVINCECAPITAL$"
 DG_Hindu.021.d:1 "Locals in $PROVINCENAME$ are flocking to visit a Sadhu (holy man) who lives there, meditating and following the Path of Renunciation.  This has upset other Sadhu in $PROVINCECAPITAL$, who declare that since he has not been initiated into a Sampradaya (religious lineage) by an existing guru, his teachings are useless at best and fraud at worst.\n\nA delegation of Brahmin have arrived at [Root.Owner.Capital.GetCapitalName] asking the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] to have the Sadhu arrested.  However, his followers plead that instead [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetSheHe] should listen to the Sant's advice."

 DG_Hindu.022.t:1 "New monastic lineage founded"
 DG_Hindu.022.d:1 "A holy ascetic (Sadhu) has become a Guru, founding a new order of monks (Sampradaya).  The order has already attracted hundreds of followers as well as thousands of ordinary Hindus who seek the prayers and advice of its founder.  The Sadhus of the new Sampradaya will surely fill the heavens with their prayers!\n\nWith over three hundred monastic orders, it seemed possible for anyone to find one they liked - yet new Sampradaya were founded every few generations by charismatic Gurus.  Since not all Sadhu belonged to an order, simply acting as ascetics without being initiated by a Guru, there were always holy men and women who followed the Paths of Salvation in their own way, attracting followers who wanted to share in their enlightenment."
 DG_Hindu.022.a:1 "May the gods be pleased"
 DG_Hindu.023.t:1 "The Incarnation of Shiva"
 DG_Hindu.023.d:1 "News has reached us of a Guru who is said to be an Avatar of Lord Shiva!  The [Root.GetAdjective] holy man is a yogi who has written religious treatises and amassed a large following among the rural parts of [Root.Country.GetName] by teaching a revolutionary way to achieve enlightenment and break the cycle of reincarnation by transcending social taboos.  To this end, his followers eat rotten food, cover their bodies in ash, use mind-altering drugs, utter profanity and even consume the flesh of the dead and wear their bones!\n\nIt should come as no surprise that these Tantric mystics are stirring up passions: the peasants believe them to have mystical powers, while the Brahmin believe them to be heretics and demand we put an end to his preaching."

 DG_Hindu.024.t:1 "The Aghoris"
 DG_Hindu.024.d:1 "An unusual sect of Sadhu (holy men and women) have grown more popular in $PROVINCENAME$ recently.  Followers of a Tantric Guru said to have been the Avatar of Lord Shiva, the Aghoris are considered to be powerful, mystical and frightening.  Believing that the true path to enlightenment comes from transcending social taboos, they eat rotten food, cover their bodies in ash, use mind-altering drugs, utter profanity, consume the flesh of the dead and wear their bones!  Popular among the peasants who believe them to have the power to give and lift curses, they are disliked by other Sadhu who consider them heretics."

 DG_Hindu.025.d:1 "Grave news: peasants in $PROVINCENAME$ have unearthed the bodies of dozens of travellers and merchants who had gone missing recently.  The corpses have been robbed of their possessions and buried shallowly among garbage to avoid detection, their joints broken to speed up decomposition.  As caravans and pilgrims stay away, the townsfolk beg us to send soldiers to protect them from this menace."

 DG_Hindu.026.d:1 "Our troops have captured a number of bandits they claim to be the culprits of the grisly murders that took place in $PROVINCENAME$.  Under torture, the bandits have confessed to being Thuggees, and with their summary execution the locals can now rest easy."
 DG_Hindu.026.a:1 "This will put an end to their activity for a generation or more"
 DG_Hindu.027.t:1 "Expedition Returns Empty-Handed"
 DG_Hindu.027.d:1 "Our troops have returned from $PROVINCENAME$ without having found any bandits.  The problem with hunting Thuggees is that their modus operandi is to blend in with their victims, making it hard for our soldiers to tell who is a genuine merchant and who is a dangerous murderer.  Our troops might well be walking among the killers, for they live a double life and often have respectable positions at home.  Although our men are returning having failed their mission, we can at least tell the locals that we were protecting them."
 DG_Hindu.027.a:1 "Bah"
 DG_Hindu.028.t:1 "Eradication of the Thuggees"
 DG_Hindu.028.d:1 "The Thuggees plagued India for centuries.  Although a powerful empire could provide some protection against them, the nature of the Thuggees dual existence as respectable members of society at home meant that they could stop their attacks for years without being eradicated.  The secret jargon and hand signs the fraternity used also helped them survive reprisals by soldiers and move across the subcontinent freely.  Over the centuries, they had carefully selected dozens of Beles - favoured places of execution with few ways out and many places to hide bodies.  Yet in the end, it was these very tactics that were turned against them.\n\nCarefully chosen [Root.Country.GetAdjective] agents disguised themselves as wealthy merchants, travelling in small numbers far from home.  Recognising each other with secret signs, they gathered among the Thuggees, then sprang a trap against them.  In a remarkably short time thousands of members of the cult had been arrested and executed.\n\nIndia is free of the Thuggees, and thousands of Indians sing the praises of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]!"
 DG_Hindu.028.a:1 "A historic day"
 DG_Hindu.029.t:1 "Donning the Holy Robe"
 DG_Hindu.029.d:1 "It seems that a notorious criminal has escaped the guards in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] by donning the 'holy robe' and pretending to be a Sadhu (holy ascetic).  This type of behaviour is unfortunately all too common; since there are so many Sadhu it is impossible to keep track of them, and vagrants and criminals can pretend to be a Sadhu for their own benefit.  Now the people of [Root.GetName] are crying out for justice, and some are even calling for us to do something about the Sadhu!\n\nSadhu are holy men and women who follow the Path of Renunciation.  Hinduism preaches many paths to salvation that can be adopted by the same person at different stages of life.  Many men and women decided to become a Sadhu late in life after having raised a family, spending their days in prayer and meditation and making pilgrimages to the sacred rivers and temples of India.  However, since anyone could become a Sadhu there was no regulation and the qualifications to be one could be low at times."

 DG_Hindu.030.t:1 "The Neo-Vedanta Movement"
 DG_Hindu.030.d:1 "Throughout the middle ages, Hindu theologians and philosophers developed no fewer than ten schools of thought to interpret the Upshanids, called Vedanta.  Those years were full of persecution and invasion - and now that they are over, we find ourselves considering the very nature of Hinduism itself.  Some, such as $THEOLOGIAN$, preach that Hinduism needs to be a single world religion.  In that view, all the many differing beliefs of Hinduism are a distortion of the basic truth of Vedanta.  If we wish Hinduism to truly be the equal of other world faiths, we need to eradicate this heresy and focus on its universal nature - the victory of Smartism.  Yet might not this medicine be worse than the cure?  By removing all the heterogeneity from our faith, we will also destroy much of its vitality."

 DG_Hindu.031.d:1 "An order of holy men and women has been established in $PROVINCENAME$ with the aim of protecting Hindu pilgrims and temples from marauding bandits and invading armies.  Their example has inspired many young men to flock to their cause and take oaths to lead the life of an ascetic, defend pilgrims, and to hire themselves out to pious Hindu rulers.\n\nWhen pilgrims attending the Kumbh Mela were slaughtered by Muslims in the fourteenth century, it inspired some Sadhu (ascetics) to take up arms in defence of their faith.  These militant Sadhu practised wrestling, Indian martial arts, and weapons.  Many were also Naga Sadhu, who wore few or no clothes."

The Gosains supported themselves by trading in these markets, bringing with them goods from far away.  At the same time, the Gosain could also be marauders and thieves, and their numbers and weaponry made it easy for them to intimidate locals.  Many Gosain were militant Sadhu who helped to protect merchants and pilgrims on their journeys, and occasionally hired themselves out as mercenaries."

 DG_Hindu.036.d:1 "With our patronage, temples to the gods are flourishing, bringing back the tradition of temple dancers, or Devadasi.  One in particular has caught our eye - a woman whose grace and beauty is sure to please the gods...or the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle].  Devadasi danced for the gods alone, surely a waste of her talents when she could be entertaining the court!  Although the Devadasi was considered married to a god, she could gain wealth and security by accepting such an offer, while the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] showed off [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] power by having such a 'Rajadasi'."

 DG_Hindu.041.d:1 "Our forces have secured [Root.GetName] for the glory of [Root.Owner.GetName]!  Legend has it that here, many years ago, the god Vishnu spilled a precious drop of the nectar of immortality (amrita) from his urn, forming the sacred river there.  Since time immemorial, pious worshippers have gathered at the shores of those four sacred rivers to bathe in them and so cleanse themselves of sin.  This has turned each of the four into immense gatherings every twelve years, when hundreds of thousands gather to bathe in an event known as the Kumbh Mela.\n\nThe four sites are: Haridwar, Garhwal (where the Ganges originates); Nasik (where the Godavari originates); Ujjain, Mandsaur (where the Shipra originates) and Allahabad (where the Ganges, Yamuna and Saraswati meet)."

 DG_Hindu.042.d:1 "Our forces have secured [Root.GetName], one of the four Char Dam.  Already the site is full of pilgrims eager to commune with the gods.\n\nMany places are sacred to Hindus, but four are singled out for their sacredness: the Char Dham, or four seats of Hinduism.  While not all Hindus complete the Char Dham in their lifetime, it is a mark of status to have done so, and all four holy sites are full of pilgrims at all times.  The four sites are sometimes referred to as the four corners of India: the temples of Badrinath in the north, Puri in the east, Rameswaram in the south and Dwarka in the west."
 DG_Hindu.043.t:1 "The Holy City of Varanasi"
 DG_Hindu.043.d:1 "The city of Varanasi is sacred to three religions - and now it is in our hands!  Hindus believe that it is sacred to the god Shiva and come to worship at its thousand temples and bathe in the holy river Ganges, hoping to cleanse their sins.  We should expect many pilgrims to come through its gates - and to leave some of their offerings in the hands of its merchants and innkeepers."
 DG_Hindu.044.t:1 "Pilgrims gather to bathe in the sacred rivers"
 DG_Hindu.044.d:1 "Tens, even hundreds of thousands of pilgrims have travelled to $PROVINCENAME$ to bathe in the sacred waters there in one of the largest religious festivals on Earth.\n\nPious worshippers and Sadhu ascetics sang hymns, prayed, and bathed themselves in the sacred waters, said to have originated in four drops of a divine elixir dropped by the god Vishnu after his victory over demons.  Each site became the focal point of a 55-day festival every twelve years, allowing worshippers to attend a 'Kumbh Mela' every three years if they wished.  It was a time for Sadhu to consult with each other, elect new leadership, initiate new members and review the law codes that governed Hindus.\n\nTraditionally, the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] was expected to distribute [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetHerHis] wealth among the people by feeding the poor and religious ascetics during the festival - while simultaneously collecting gifts as tribute from loyal retainers.  It was a chance for a pious ruler to prove [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetHerHis] generosity - or to collect bribes."

The difference between a crowd and a mob is little indeed when people are afraid or angry, and bad weather, empty bellies and long lines could lead to both.  Sometimes the festival ended with hundreds trampled underfoot - an embarrassment for its host."
 DG_Hindu.047.t:1 "Religious debates"
 DG_Hindu.047.d:1 "With so many ascetics gathered in one place, the Kumbh Mela was the obvious place for holy men and women to debate theology.  Ideas were presented and rejected, beliefs challenged and affirmed.  It was hard to say which way the winds would blow when it came to the gods."

As the blood of slain holy monks mixes with the sacred waters, the sanctity of the ceremony is in doubt.\n\nBy the fourteenth century large numbers of militant Sadhu orders were a commonplace feature at the Kumbh Mela.  Taking oaths to protect pilgrims from violence, the Sadhus were highly respected and welcomed at the festival and often given pride of first place at the baths.

 DG_Hindu.061.d_marriage:1 "A mixed-caste marriage has caused a scandal in [Root.GetName], with a [Root.Culture.GetName] Vaishya man marrying a poor Brahmin woman.  The caste system required Hindus to marry within their caste.  However, it did allow for mixed caste marriages in rare cases - as long as it involved a higher-caste man marrying a lower-caste woman, for religious law said that a woman gained the qualities of her husband and so was raised to a higher caste.  When the opposite happened, however, it was said to bring chaos and ruin to the land.  People are scared of divine retribution, and the Brahmin are furious at the insult to their caste.  This kind of 'Pratiloma' marriage was forbidden in the Vedas - but was it forbidden in [Root.Owner.GetName]?"

Although all Hindus fell into one of five castes, in practise they were divided into almost four thousand subcastes based on their profession, land ownership, local customs and relationship with local lords.  These associations, or Jati, often changed status as land changed hands, mixed marriages occurred, people moved to a new region, or local rulers changed policies.  It could get particularly messy when two castes both claimed the same profession, or when members of a Jati performed two jobs simultaneously that fell into different castes.  With their status in doubt, it could lead to conflict between Jatis and the rest of society over what their caste should be.\n\nIn cases like these, it was up to the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] to decide. Declaring them to be high status would gain their favour, but alienate local elites, while declaring them low status would do the opposite.\n"

 DG_Hindu.062.d_mil_3:1 "In this case, an association of Kshatriya zamindars have evolved into landowners who earn money from rents rather than the feudal soldiers they ought to be, and in so doing becoming wealthier."
 DG_Hindu.062.d_dip:1 "In this case, an association of wealthy financiers and moneylenders has emerged in [Root.Capital.GetName] with the growth of the Money Economy.  With this job not covered in the scriptures, it could be considered to be part of the low-caste Vaishya traders, or it could be part of the richer, educated Brahmin castes."
 DG_Hindu.062.d_dip_2:1 "In this case, the movement of peasant workers off rural farms to [Root.Capital.GetName] has allowed them to take on higher-paying jobs as craftsmen and artisans, bringing them into conflict with Vaishya traders who claim to have a monopoly on such trades in [Root.GetName]."

 DG_Hindu.062.d_adm_2:1 "In this case, as the administrative apparatus devoted to the upkeep of land records has grown in [Root.GetName], so too has the demand for scribes.  With the local Brahmin considering this kind of labour beneath them, an association of educated, professional Shudra scribes has emerged."
 DG_Hindu.062.d_adm_3:1 "In this case, an association of Brahmin have spread into an aboriginal area, setting themselves up as farmers there.  This is considered to be a degradation of their role as clergy."

In some regions, one caste could be entirely absent, while in others it could dominate the population.  When one caste was absent, it could fall to other castes to take on their jobs, effectively changing their status in the process - or it could be solved by moving populations around, often expanding their influence in the process."
 DG_Hindu.063.d_mil:1 "The province has a shortage of Kshatriya warriors to serve as soldiers, officers and tax collectors.  In many cases, low-caste Shudra workers happily served as soldiers, while the sons of educated Vaishya could become commanders and tax collectors.  In other cases, Kshatriya in other provinces were offered generous land grants to migrate to the region."
 DG_Hindu.063.d_adm:1 "The province has a shortage of Brahmin priests to serve as priests, scribes and bureaucrats.  In many cases, wealthy but low-caste Vaishya merchants could educate their sons to take on similar roles, while ambitious Kshatriya warriors could seek to take over government jobs.  However, there were always more Brahmin than high-paying positions, and guaranteeing them land and titles would surely entice Brahmin to migrate to the region."
 DG_Hindu.063.d_dip:1 "The province has a shortage of Vaishya merchants to serve as traders, artisans and craftsmen.  In many cases, low-caste Shudra workers were eager to raise their status by selling their wares, while some landowning Brahmin and Kshatriya were willing to invest money in the trades.

 DG_Hindu.064.d:1 "Recently, there has been a movement against the caste system in [Root.GetName], led by a man of high caste."
 DG_Hindu.064.d_1:1 "While Hinduism's caste system tied children to their parent's profession in theory, there was always some mobility in practise.  Individuals who rose to a higher caste than their parents through education, marriage or opportunity were expected to embrace the taboos and norms associated with their new status.  Some, however, like the [Root.Culture.GetName] young man in this case, attempted to raise the status of their entire caste as they rose."
 DG_Hindu.064.d_2:1 "Due to the risk of being singled out for punishment, some high-caste Brahmin or Kshatriyas would hide their caste from conquerors.  Over time, their children would maintain the illusion, eventually forgetting their original high status.  This could be reversed by a Brahmanic ritual that restored their original caste to the entire population, a process known alternately as Brahminization or Kshatriyazation depending on the caste.  Of course, it was always possible to make this claim even if there was no evidence for it, so some high caste leaders - such as the [Root.Culture.GetName] young man in this case - earned the loyalty of the population by promising them a higher status.  Inevitably, this resulted in a backlash from the population that already belonged to that caste and had no need of competition."
 DG_Hindu.064.d_3:1 "Brahmin priests generally supported the caste system, not only because they were tasked with the dharma of teaching it, but also because they were said to rest on top of it.  However, some Brahmin priests practised a devotional kind of Hinduism called Bhakti.  To these priests, the caste system was an obstacle preventing the average Hindu from true devotion to the gods and so imperilled their rebirth.  Some - like the Brahmin in this case - spoke out against the system itself and demanded equality for all Hindus instead.  Naturally, this made him a traitor to his caste, but popular among the lower castes."

This new guru preached a more militant religion which required all baptized men to carry a weapon at all times, practise sword fighting and defend the faith with their lives.  He personally led these fanatical followers into battle.  Despite some victories, the guru knew this was inevitably a losing cause, so he declared that he was the last living guru.

And Sikhs had many enemies by $YEAR$.  Faced with persecution, the guru came up with a daring idea: he had the Sikh religion codified into a holy book and named it his successor - the last and eternal guru 'Granth Sahib'.  Some of these codes were new: all Sikh males had to wear a blade on them at all times, learn swordsmanship, and fight for their faith when demanded, and the most dedicated would join an elite, religious order of holy warriors known as the Khalsa Order.

But even these sacred fires are nothing compared to the three Great Fires of antiquity.  Each of the three was brought to Earth by Ahura Mazda himself on the back of an ox, left to burn for eternity to dispel doubt about Zoroastrianism and protect humankind from evil.  After the conquest, they were extinguished, even their locations lost to us.  To many Zoroastrians, they were seen as purely metaphorical fires - yet that is not so, for today, we have found one."

The corollary to this is that marrying one's own kin is sacred, guaranteeing paradise for those who practised it.  Sassanian emperors routinely married their own mothers, daughters and sisters, simultaneously proving that they were following scripture and consolidating royal blood to avoid succession crises.  High priests may also have practised it as a kind of reenactment of divine myths, although it is unclear just how much it was practised beyond the royal family.\n\nThe holiest of all marriages was said to have been son to mother, producing a brother-son from the union.  This provoked disgust and condemnation from other countries, who saw the act as incest rather than a divine duty."

This kind of marriage allowed the husband to substitute for a deceased in-law, so that one or more children from the marriage were legally assigned as the children of the wife's brother, father or uncle.\n\nSubstitute marriages were uncommon, but not unheard of.  Keeping the family line intact was especially important for Zoroastrians since the Avestas state that sons carry the souls of their parents over the bridge of judgement into Paradise.  For this reason, it was important that sons be of one's family line, not adopted.  A substitute allowed this lineage to be preserved in the eyes of Ahura Mazda."

Many Zoroastrians felt that it belonged more to the pagan heritage of Persia than to the simple, monotheistic faith of individual responsibility that Zoroaster had created - especially when it was combined with the ritualistic drinking of Houma extract.  Was this Daeva-yasna - the worship of false gods that Zoroaster had warned them against?  Or was it Zoroastrian law?

This particular priest has been particularly transparent about his greed, and those he has coerced into payments include high-ranking officials and their families.\n\nIn Zoroastrianism, the forgiveness of sins was a ritual in which the penitent spent seven to nine days performing a ritual without touching water or fire.  The final step was corporal punishment, but it could be offset by paying a fine commensurate to the sin and to one's station, which meant that a provincial lord was required to pay far more than a sharecropper.

Priesthood was hereditary, passed down from father to son in the Asronih caste, who were barred from marrying outside their caste.

It was possible to increase their numbers by accepting Asronih men who were not devout, but this had its own problems."

These new \"Arab scriptures\" were written in Pahlavi instead of the original Avestan, but they filled in many holes in the scriptures.  However, this new scripture had a distinctly Muslim character to it.  For example, the original Avesta began with the phrase §B\"For the pleasure of Ahura Mazda\"§!, while the newer version started with §B\"In the name of God, the Compassionate, Merciful and Kind\"§! in an echo of the Qu'ran.  In a mirror of the 99 names of Allah, they included the 101 names of Hormazd.  Most notably, the new Avestas emphasised the importance of saying the Din-no Kalmo (\"Profession of Faith\") daily, in which Zoroastrians affirmed there was only one God, Ahura Mazda, and Zoroaster was His prophet.\n\nThis all led to Zoroastrians questioning the veracity of the Arab writings.  Were they in fact the originals, perhaps influencing Islam?  Were they added by Zoroastrians who lived at the mercy of Muslims, hoping to stay in their good graces?  Did it even matter?"

 DG_Zoroastrian.066.d:1 "The Prophet Zoroaster stamped out worship of the Persian nature gods and replaced it with the worship of Ahura Mazda alone.  However, the gods he supplanted returned after his death.  The Gathas - hymns to Ahura Mazda written by Zoroaster himself - demand worship of only one god.  The Book of Yashts, on the other hand, contained hymns that personified aspects of Ahura Mazda as angels, demons or demigods.  In this way, the judgement at the Bridge of Separation became the duty of Mithras, Sraosa and Rasnu, while the \"Inner Voice of God\" was named as Seraosha the warrior.  Other pagan deities showed up as Yazatas, spirits who helped Ahura Mazda in his struggle against evil.\n\nThe more we study the Avestas, the more this issue divides our people.  Some Zoroastrians sought to declare the later scriptures heretical and return to a more fundamental form of Zoroastrianism, arguing that the later scriptures had allowed heresies such as the Zurvanites to emerge.  Others fought to keep the later scriptures, arguing that they were part of a living religion that embraced the cultural legacy of the Persians."

Large portions were lost when Alexander the Great burned Persepolis, leaving Zoroastrianism to languish until the Sassanid restoration.  Under Shapur I, Zoroastrian priests attempted to rebuild the Avesta, purging Zurvanist myths but including Encyclopedic works on metaphysics, astronomy, geography, hygiene, plants and medicine to complement existing books on rituals, liturgy and law.  Many of these newer \"Hadha\" books were adapted from Greek philosophy, something that had spread throughout Persia after it fell to Alexander.

Other scriptures were written in Younger Avestan, a regional variant of Avestan spoken during the Sassanid era.  But both languages went into a steep decline after the conquest, and by the ninth century it was necessary to write modern commentaries in the vernacular of the day: Pahlavi (Middle Persian).\n\nBy $YEAR$, even Pahlavi was a dead language.

A man who converted to Islam was promised not only that he would no longer have to pay the Jizya tax, but also that he would inherit all his father's lands, even if he had brothers.  This, combined with the occasional pogrom, left the Zoroastrian population smaller and poorer with each generation, until they subsisted as a despised underclass.

 caste_system_harsh:1 "Harsh Caste System"
 desc_caste_system_harsh:1 "A religious caste system is legally enforced by the state, with violators punished harshly lest we draw the wrath of the gods for their bad karma.  Marriage between castes is strictly prohibited, occupations are exclusive to caste, sons are required to enter the same profession as their fathers, and the faithful are banned from interacting with those considered ritually unclean.\n\nThe caste system is maintained by an elaborate system of rituals regulating social interaction.  It set out rules for each caste to follow to avoid being shunned by their caste members or acquiring bad karma for their next life.  The system ranked every person and community into one of four or five castes depending on their ancestry, from the priests and warriors on the top to the farmers and artisans on the bottom.  It had many benefits: it ensured a steady source of labour, encouraged labour specialisation and religion, and provided care for low-caste individuals in society.  However, it also discouraged social mobility and societal change."

 desc_caste_system_loose:1 "A religious caste system is enforced in our nation through public shaming and informal sanctions.  Marriage between castes is shocking, castes form guilds to protect their interest in specific occupations, sons are expected to enter the same profession as their fathers, and the faithful are expected to avoid those considered ritually unclean - but there are a number of ways to circumvent these restrictions, allowing for some intragenerational social mobility.\n\nThe caste system is maintained by an elaborate system of rituals regulating social interaction.

 zarvanite_sect:1 "Zurvanism"
 desc_zarvanite_sect:1 "As the state church of Sassanid Persia, Zurvanism had thrived - but lacking its support, it had dwindled and then disappeared.  The sect believed in a single creator god who did not demand worship, demoting both Ohrmazd and Ahriman to secondary roles.  Instead, the sect focused on philosophy, taking an abstract view of religion.  All this was difficult for the average layman to follow, so without trained, state-supported priests, the church tended to lack the support of the laity."

Incest between direct family members was treated as immoral and illegal.

 thuggee_explanation:1 "\nAll signs point to this being the work of a fraternity of bandits known as the Sthaga or Thuggee ('Deceivers').  Beginning in the fourteenth century, this group of hereditary bandits preyed upon travellers on long journeys far from home.  They worked in small groups, using secret jargon to communicate with each other while pretending to be travellers who sought to journey together with their victims for mutual protection.  Along the way, they would attack their victims during rest periods in isolated spots far from towns and soldiers.  Devotees of Kali, the Thuggees are forbidden from shedding blood, so the cultists would work in threes to loop a cord around a victim's head while another pair held him down.  Children among their victims would be kidnapped and taught to join the Thuggees while wives waited at home, often unaware of their husband's true profession.\n "
