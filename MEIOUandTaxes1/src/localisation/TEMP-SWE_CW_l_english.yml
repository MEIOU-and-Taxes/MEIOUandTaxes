 flavor_swe.913311.t:1 "According to a treaty with Norway, Lappmarken was considered as Swedish territory. De facto, it was a no-man's land difficult to colonise. Sami populations maintained their independence and their culture. But, with time, our Swedish population has started to slowly migrate into the region, to a point we can now exert control over it.\n\nWe have several options:\n* Increase our control over Lappmarken, but restrict Swedish inhabitants to farming, without access to Sami lands;\n* Full control over Lappmarken, forcing the Sami population into submission;\n* Lappmarken is of little interest for us."
