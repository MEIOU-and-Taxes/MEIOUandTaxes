 western_halberd_infantry:1 "Halberdiers"
 western_halberd_infantryDESCR:1 "Halberds were a kind of polearm with both a spearhead and axe head, giving its wielder more versatility during close combat against heavy infantry.  They came into common use during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries."
 western_spearman_infantry:1 "Spearmen"
 western_spearman_infantryDESCR:1 "By the early fourteenth century, infantry had begun to adapt to cavalry tactics by fighting in curved formations with a line of pavese-style shield bearers protecting a line of spearmen, who kept the enemy away from the crossbowmen inside the formation."
 western_knight_cavalry:1 "Armoured Knights"
 western_knight_cavalryDESCR:1 "For hundreds of years, armoured knights ruled the battlefields of Western Europe.  These heavily armoured nobles, trained in the arts of war and assisted by squires and servants, would launch charges against the enemy forces.  Against light infantry, these charges usually resulted in panicked troops breaking formation and scattering across the battlefield."
 western_raid_cavalry:1 "Raid Cavalry"
 western_raid_cavalryDESCR:1 "Developed out of necessity during the Black Plague when manpower was scarce, Raid Cavalry used hit-and-run tactics to undermine the enemy and force them into confrontations that favoured one side.  Lightly armed and armoured, small numbers of Raid Cavalry would launch surprise attacks against farms, towns, and supply trains, distracting enemy soldiers, taking hostages, seizing supplies and causing unrest.  Raid Cavalry was called Chevauchee by the French during the Hundred Years War, Reivers by the Scots when fighting the English, and Cavalgada by the Spanish raiding into Muslim territory.  However, although they were an important asset during wars, Raid Cavalry were weak on the battlefield."
 western_hobelar_cavalry:1 "Hobelar Cavalry"
 western_hobelar_cavalryDESCR:1 "Developed in order to fight in the dense woods and bogs of Ireland, Hobelar cavalry were light cavalrymen who wore hauberks and fought with swords and lances.  This allowed them to travel fast and manoeuvre quickly, which gave the Hobelars an edge in reconnaissance and scouting missions.  They took their name from the hobby horses they rode, a kind of fast, agile horse."
 western_runner_cavalry:1 "Runner Cavalry"
 western_runner_cavalryDESCR:1 "The use of longbows that could punch through armour gave infantry the upper hand in the fourteenth century.  This spurred an arms race in which elite heavy cavalry known as Reinier or Panzerati wore increasingly heavy armour designed to protect them from arrows.  The tactics remained the same, but the heavier plate mail returned control of the battlefield to the horseman."
 western_mountedarcher_cavalry:1 "Mounted Archers"
 western_mountedarcher_cavalryDESCR:1 "With the proven effectiveness of the bow in battle, armies in Western Europe began to replace light hobelar with mounted archers who could act as raiders and scouts as well as harass the enemy from afar.  Although not as effective as longbowmen, mounted archers could be deadly in large numbers and were able to react quickly to exploit weaknesses and withdraw from battle when necessary.  They proved their worth at the battle of Crecy, when English mounted archers turned back a French charge."
 western_jinete_cavalry:1 "Ginete Light Cavalry"
 western_jinete_cavalryDESCR:1 "During the Reconquista, both Muslims and Christians made use of horsemen who lived along the border and made their living by raiding the enemy, variously called Jinetes, Ginetes, Giniza or Genitours.  Armed with javelins, light lances and broad-bladed swords who wore only cuirasses and helmets, they were fast and manoeuvrable cavalry who used Moorish tactics on the battlefield.  They harassed the enemy, launching javelins and keeping their distance until the enemy ranks fell into disorder, then charged with their light lances.  Another tactic was to feign retreat, then lure the enemy into a trap.  They were also used by both sides to raid and to hunt down enemy raiders.  After the Reconquista ended, the Spanish and Italians adopted their tactics as a regular part of the army, eventually making up between one and two-thirds of their cavalry."
 western_freecompany_infantry:1 "Free Companies"
 western_freecompany_infantryDESCR:1 "The predominance of conscript footsoldiers in medieval armies, and the expense of maintaining armoured knights, led to the emergence of mercenaries who were highly trained and well-armed infantry.  Their heavy armour gave them an edge over regular armies, and free companies such as the Condotta of Italy achieved predominance on the battlefield.  However, free companies fought for themselves first, their employers second.  Their tactics were designed to minimise their own losses, not fight to the death in a losing cause."
 western_condottieri_cavalry:1 "Condottieri Cavalry"
 western_condottieri_cavalryDESCR:1 "It was expensive to maintain armoured knights on horseback.  Only feudal nobility could afford to do so - or professional mercenaries.  Nations that lacked landed nobles or who did not trust them often established permanent relationships with mercenary bands who fought as heavy cavalry.  They wore heavy armour, carried swords and lances, and rode warhorses.  As professional soldiers, they were highly trained, but as mercenaries they were prone to retreating when the battle turned against them."
 western_longbow_infantry:1 "Longbowmen"
 western_longbow_infantryDESCR:1 "Bows have been in use for thousands of years.  Larger bows, such as the English Longbow, had longer range and more power, allowing them to penetrate the heavy armour worn by knights on the battlefield.  They had a high rate of fire and were accurate over long distances, making them especially useful in war.  However, longbows demanded intensive training in order to use them effectively, making it difficult to raise large armies.  In the end, they disappeared from the battlefield not because they were obsolete, but because it was cheaper and easier to train peasants to use firearms."
 western_manatarms_infantry:1 "Men at Arms"
 western_manatarms_infantryDESCR:1 "The feudal system encouraged knights to raise private armies of men at arms to support them in combat.  These professional soldiers made up the gentry, a class below the aristocracy but above the working classes.  In combat, they fought on foot, heavily armed and armoured, but working in small units for their lords rather than in large regiments."
 western_lance_infantry:1 "Lance Infantry"
 western_lance_infantryDESCR:1 "Knights and Men-at-Arms were effective soldiers but not effective armies.  Although highly trained and heavily armoured, they fought in small units and their tactics and arms varied immensely.  During the fourteenth century, some countries began to try and regulate them, placing them into larger units and standardising their weaponry and tactics.  By the end of the Hundred Years War, the French had developed a standard unit consisting of 'lances' that each contained men-at-arms, archers and supporting foot soldiers, allowing them to work and fight together with more discipline."
 western_gendarme_cavalry:1 "Gendarme Cavalry"
 western_gendarme_cavalryDESCR:1 "Knights and Men-at-Arms were effective soldiers but not effective armies.  Although highly trained and heavily armoured, they fought in small units and their tactics and arms varied immensely.  During the fourteenth century, some countries began to try and regulate them, placing them into larger units and standardising their weaponry and tactics.  By the end of the Hundred Years War, the French had developed a professional class of 'Gens d'Armes' (Men of Arms), armoured cavalry who were not nobles and so were willing to take orders and fight in large units."
 western_escopeteros_cavalry:1 "Mounted Arquebusiers"
 western_escopeteros_cavalryDESCR:1 "With the introduction of flintlock guns, light cavalry began to carry firearms with them.  Herreruelos wore plate armour and charged in close to fire their pistols and then charged the enemy.  Herguletiers wore leather and fired their arquebuses from the flanks to support the infantry.  Unlike later dragoons, Mounted Arquebusiers were always meant as cavalry and could engage in charges and hand-to-hand combat with their swords.  They replaced Ginete cavalry during the Italian wars."
 western_stradioti_cavalry:1 "Stradioti Mercenaries"
 western_stradioti_cavalryDESCR:1 "Mercenaries who came from the Balkans, bringing with them a unique way of fighting.  Unlike western cavalry, Stradioti used hit-and-run tactics, ambushes and feigned retreats to cut down their foe.  Their favourite weapon was a short lance called an assagaie which could unhorse enemy knights although they also used throwing javelins and heavy maces.  They wore chain mail hauberks which could stand up to fighting, although it was not nearly as strong as the armour western knights wore.  The unorthodox way Stradioti fought earned them a place in the armies of Western Europe, but they were famously undisciplined and prone to looting rather than fighting.  Another issue was that most of them were Orthodox, and a few were actually Muslims."
 western_pike_infantry:1 "Pikemen"
 western_pike_infantryDESCR:1 "The dominance of heavy cavalry on the battlefield led some countries to reintroduce the tactics of ancient Greece by introducing light infantry who fought mainly with long spears or pikes in tight ranks called Zileten.  These square formations could stop a cavalry charge cold and returned control of the battlefield to infantry, who adapted the pike in the Renaissance to allow for aggressive attacks - but it relied on discipline, confidence, and coordination, making it vital to have professional soldiers instead of badly-trained conscripts.  Unfortunately, the same design that made it so effective against cavalry - densely-packed squares of spearmen - also made it extremely vulnerable to gunfire."
 western_charge_infantry:1 "Charge Infantry"
 western_charge_infantryDESCR:1 "Unable to fight open field battles against the English, the Scottish developed Galloglaigh infantry, armoured soldiers who would use cover to launch ambushes against the enemy, charging forward at close range to enemy lines.  This tactic worked well in close quarters, but was less effective in open warfare."
 western_pikeandshot_infantry:1 "Pike and Shot"
 western_pikeandshot_infantryDESCR:1 "Early firearms were slow and inaccurate, making them impractical on the battlefield.  However, if protected by a screen of pikemen, they could reload in peace and attack enemies who stayed out of range of the pikes.  Using these 'pike and shot' tactics, heavily outnumbered Spanish forces were able to rout French forces during the Italian Wars - and in so doing, secured the place of this formation for decades."
 western_wheellock_infantry:1 "Wheellock Handgunners"
 western_wheellock_infantryDESCR:1 "Early arquebuses were matchlocks that relied on a slowly burning fuse to fire the gun, making it nearly useless in wet weather and unreliable the rest of the time. By the early sixteenth century, a new wheellock mechanism was developed which used a rotating steel wheel to ignite the gunpowder.  This made arquebuses much more reliable than before as well as easier to conceal in battle (there was no tell-tale glow or smoke before the shot was fired), which also made them more dangerous: many countries banned the wheellock entirely for this reason.  In Italy, Schiopettieri hand gunners became commonplace in the French invasions."
 western_freeshooter_infantry:1 "Free Shooter Infantry"
 western_freeshooter_infantryDESCR:1 "As guns became deadlier and more common on battlefields, charge infantry changed tactics. They were still trained and equipped to fight up-close, but they deliberately waited for the enemy to shoot before charging. Because guns could take so long to reload, they could often close the distance before the enemy had a chance to fire twice, and both arquebuses and muskets were notoriously inaccurate at longer ranges. This strategy was risky but paid off handsomely when it succeeded."
 western_earlytercio_infantry:1 "Early Tercio Infantry"
 western_earlytercio_infantryDESCR:1 "The Spanish developed a formation that was made up of one-third arquebusiers, one-third pikemen, and one-third swordsmen, all trained soldiers.  The result was a unit that could fight any kind of enemy on the battlefield, defending itself from cavalry charges or regular troops while still firing on the enemy.  The result was so effective that it became the model for Western Europe until the seventeenth century."
 western_caracole_cavalry:1 "Caracole Cavalry"
 western_caracole_cavalryDESCR:1 "In the late sixteenth and early seventeenth century the most common combat formation for western European cavalry was the Caracole, which could be employed in two ways. With the first method, the first rank of the cavalry formation charged directly at the enemy, the cavalrymen firing their weapons at a range of 30 to 50 paces. Then they turned round again and returned to the rear of the formation and became the last rank. The following rank would charge in the same way, fire at the enemy and return to the rear. With this formation the first rank was always charging while the other ranks were loading and waiting their turn to charge. Another method was to charge in a single file, firing when the enemies were on their right and then continuing round in a circular motion, all the while reloading and returning to reform the lines in a continuous attack."
 western_cuirassier_cavalry:1 "Cuirassiers"
 western_cuirassier_cavalryDESCR:1 "The Cuirassiers was a type of heavy cavalry that evolved from the armoured knight. This type of cavalry was armoured from his head down to knee-level. His body was protected with a breastplate, or 'Cuirass', from which they took their name. The breastplate was designed to withstand not only the shot from a pistol but also that of ball fired from a musket. They were armed with wheellock pistols, lances and swords. Cuirassiers were mostly used as shock troops and were in use for centuries."
 western_tercio_infantry:1 "Tercio Infantry"
 western_tercio_infantryDESCR:1 "Early Square formations relied on pikemen to support a small number of arquebusiers, but as guns became deadlier and more reliable the number of arquebusiers in the square grew and the number of pikemen shrank from 2:1 to 1:2. By the end of the century most squares were dominated by arquebusiers, gaining increased firepower without sacrificing defence. This helped to keep the Tercio the predominant tactic used on the battlefield in Western Europe."
 western_soldaty_infantry:1 "Soldaty Charge Infantry"
 western_soldaty_infantryDESCR:1 "The Square formation was popular but had its limitations. It resulted in slow-moving, dense formations of arquebusiers that abandoned control of the battlefield to more manoeuvrable opponents. Countries that relied on infantry to take the offensive abandoned the Square and adopted Soldaty tactics for their musketeers, combining muskets and halberds to take the battle to their enemy."
 western_gallop_cavalry:1 "Gallop Cavalry"
 western_gallop_cavalryDESCR:1 "Armies trained in Western European warfare quite often came out second best in combat against pistol armed cavalry in Eastern Europe. Faced with superior cavalry in the Polish Wars, the Swedish army developed Gallop Cavalry to compensate.  Although still armed with pistols like the Caracole, Gallop cavalry did not discharge the pistols as preliminary to shock action but as part of the charge itself. The results were devastating during the Thirty Years' War."
 western_irregular_infantry:1 "Musketeer Irregulars"
 western_irregular_infantryDESCR:1 "Lighter and handier matchlock muskets replaced the older arquebus. Muskets could fire a two-ounce ball nearly two hundred yards, making them much deadlier on the battlefield. However, the fifteen-pound guns were bulky and required a forked stick to rest the barrel on when firing, making loading complicated and lengthy.  Acting as irregulars, musketeers could take the initiative on the battlefield with their increased firepower and range.  It was this tactic which enabled the French Bluecoats to take the initiative on the battlefield and win countless battles."
 western_dragoon_cavalry:1 "Dragoons"
 western_dragoon_cavalryDESCR:1 "In the seventeenth century, a new type of cavalry called Dragoons was created. Dragoons were basically infantry who transported themselves by horse. The name Dragoon comes from the weapon they carried a short type of musket or carbine, called dragon. Dragoons were widely used by all European nations mostly because they were cheaper than normal cavalry."
 western_musketeersquare_infantry:1 "Musketeer Square"
 western_musketeersquare_infantryDESCR:1 "Lighter and handier matchlock muskets replaced the older arquebus. Muskets could fire a two-ounce ball nearly two hundred yards, making them much deadlier on the battlefield. However, the fifteen-pound guns were bulky and required a forked stick to rest the barrel on when firing, making loading complicated and lengthy.  The increased firepower and range made it a worthwhile investment, but the slow-moving musketeers were still used to support cavalry by many countries.  In particular, the Austrian Whitecoats and Spanish Tercios both made use of the musket to breathe new life into old tactics."
 western_countermarch_infantry:1 "Countermarch Musketeers"
 western_countermarch_infantryDESCR:1 "Although they were reaching parity with bows, muskets were still a risky weapon to rely on because once fired it took a long time to reload. Pikemen were required to protect the musketeers during reloading, limiting their offensive power. This changed in the early seventeenth century when Maurice of Nassau divided his musketeers into six ranks. The front rank fired, then moved to the back to reload while the next rank took their turn, and in so doing allowed the regiment to be firing at the enemy constantly. This required a great deal of training to be able to work together and a familiarity with their weapons, and to accomplish this, standard terms of command were introduced to guarantee uniformity."
 western_volley_infantry:1 "Volley Fire Musketeers"
 western_volley_infantryDESCR:1 "During the thirty years war, Sweden's king Gustavus Adolphus revolutionized warfare by training his musketeers vigorously in a new tactic. Instead of using countermarch tactics, the troops were trained to stand in three lines so that at any time one line was kneeling, one line was crouching, and one line was firing at the enemy. This demanded an incredible level of discipline and training to accomplish, making Swedish troops some of the most professional in the world. In addition, regiments were reduced from 3,000 men to a mere 500, making them more manoeuvrable on the battlefield."
 western_platoon_infantry:1 "Platoon Fire Musketeers"
 western_platoon_infantryDESCR:1 "Bayonets were introduced in the mid-seventeenth century and were gradually refined and made more reliable.  Throughout the seventeenth century tactics remained the same: musketeers advanced slowly on the enemy, pausing to fire volleys at them in an attempt to break the enemy line, allowing cavalry to pursue and mop up the scattered enemy.  When this failed, a bayonet charge and hand-to-hand combat was necessary.  This tactic gradually made pikemen superfluous on the battlefield, and where there had been three pikemen to every musketeer by the beginning of the century, there were five musketeers to every pikemen by its end.  Scottish Highlanders were known for being willing to charge the enemy just as much as shoot at them."
 western_regular_infantry:1 "Musketeer Regulars"
 western_regular_infantryDESCR:1 "Bayonets were introduced in the mid-seventeenth century and were gradually refined and made more reliable.  Throughout the seventeenth century tactics remained the same: musketeers advanced slowly on the enemy, pausing to fire volleys at them in an attempt to break the enemy line, allowing cavalry to pursue and mop up the scattered enemy.  When this failed, a bayonet charge and hand-to-hand combat was necessary.  This tactic gradually made pikemen superfluous on the battlefield, and where there had been three pikemen to every musketeer by the beginning of the century, there were five musketeers to every pikemen by its end.  British Redcoats used their bayonets to keep the enemy at bay while picking them off with musket fire."
 western_carabinier_cavalry:1 "Carabiniers"
 western_carabinier_cavalryDESCR:1 "The Carabiniers first came into being in the late sixteenth century and were a type of heavy cavalry that had many things in common with Cuirassiers. They also wore protective armour, though slightly less than a Cuirassier. The main difference between the two cavalry forces was their armament. A Carabinier's main weapon was the carbine, a short wheellock handgun. In addition to the carbine, they were also armed with a sword."
 western_armeblanche_cavalry:1 "Arme Blanche Cavalry"
 western_armeblanche_cavalryDESCR:1 "While the hussar Cavalry represented the balance between fire and shock and the Dragoon cavalry relied primarily on their muskets, Arme Blanche cavalry relied primarily on cold steel. The bold charges of these units could shatter enemy formations."
 western_mediumhussar_cavalry:1 "Medium Hussars"
 western_mediumhussar_cavalryDESCR:1 "Armoured Knights remained the predominant form of cavalry in Western Europe long after other parts of the world had moved toward more mobile light cavalry.  At the battle of Adrianople, the cream of Western European nobility met the Ottoman light cavalry and was soundly defeated by their superior mobility.  In comparison, the Hungarians and Poles used lighter cavalry called Hussars that had more success.  Forced to confront this new reality, Western European armies began to adopt Polish Winged Hussar cavalry in place of the aristocratic knights."
 western_bayonet_infantry:1 "Bayonet Infantry"
 western_bayonet_infantryDESCR:1 "The use of volley tactics, the introduction of safer, more reliable flintlock muskets and the use of bayonets in close combat eliminated the need for pikemen on the battlefield by the turn of the eighteenth century, and soon new tactics were developed to suit.  Now that fusiliers had reliable bayonets, infantry charges were once again a viable strategy in battle, allowing them to once again claim the initiative on the battlefield."
 western_line_infantry:1 "Line Infantry"
 western_line_infantryDESCR:1 "The use of volley tactics, the introduction of safer, more reliable flintlock muskets and the use of bayonets in close combat eliminated the need for pikemen on the battlefield by the turn of the eighteenth century.  Soon afterwards, new tactics were developed to suit this reality.  The most popular and arguably most effective tactic was to form a thin line facing the enemy so that musketeers could inflict maximum casualties on the enemy and react quickly to enemy movement. This also allowed for specialised soldiers to appear along the line such as the grenadier, while regular musketeers earned the name fusiliers after their flintlocks."
 western_skirmisher_infantry:1 "Irregular Skirmishers"
 western_skirmisher_infantryDESCR:1 "Standing armies were small, and even in the seventeenth century levies were called upon during wartime to make up the bulk of the army. These conscript troops did not have the training or discipline of regulars and were often distrusted by their commanders. With more accurate and faster guns making pike screens unnecessary, some commanders began using these men as irregular infantry who operated as marksmen and skirmishers in small units around the main army. These irregular skirmishers could help scout unfamiliar terrain, pin down enemy units until the main force could arrive, and best of all, were expendable.  Austria in particular made great use of their 'Grenzers', who made up over a quarter of the Austrian army."
 western_hunter_cavalry:1 "Hunter Cavalry"
 western_hunter_cavalryDESCR:1 "Hunter cavalry were lightly armoured units trained for rapid action.  They specialised in skirmishes and were renowned for their shooting skills.  They proved so useful during the shifting lines of battle that the French army developed these 'Chasseur à Cheval' into a significant part of their cavalry."
 western_uhlan_cavalry:1 "Uhlans"
 western_uhlan_cavalryDESCR:1 "The first Uhlans were created in the early eighteenth century. They were used primarily for reconnaissance for the more heavily armoured cavalry, as well as being assigned to skirmishes. Later on they became an essential part of the military structure due to their light armour, making them fast and agile on the battlefield, and for their high shock value against their enemies.  Uhlan cavalry were a good alternative to large infantry armies as they were not only heavy hitting but also more cost effective. This allowed smaller nations with less manpower to actually put up an effective fight, as armies on foot were also slower compared to their mounted counterparts."
 western_lighthussar_cavalry:1 "Light Hussars"
 western_lighthussar_cavalryDESCR:1 "As Cavalry became more specialised, the Hussar started to evolve. The Hussar unit became less like the heavy Polish Hussar and more like the light Hungarian original. The ability of these light and mobile troops to find the enemy, harass them, and overrun their artillery more than made up for their lack of armour."
 western_drill_infantry:1 "Drill Infantry"
 western_drill_infantryDESCR:1 "Able to fight at close range or from further away, musketeers were versatile indeed - but only if they could react quickly to the shifting battlefield. Frederick of Prussia trained his men rigorously to deal with any situation that could conceivably come up until they became an incredible fighting force that never broke ranks and could fire as much as one shot every fifteen seconds under combat conditions!  This Prussian Drill infantry became the model army for the rest of the world after its stunning successes in battle and was used by both sides in the American Revolution."
 western_mass_infantry:1 "Mass Infantry"
 western_mass_infantryDESCR:1 "A favourite of the Russians, highly drilled Mass Infantry could be relied on to charge while under fire without breaking, resulting in terrible casualties for the enemy if it succeeded in reaching enemy lines. The bayonet and constant drill brought back the charge tactic in force: mass infantry launched a devastating volley of fire at their enemy, then set their bayonets and charged.  The result could be deadly to their enemies when it succeeded - or deadly to their own side if it failed."
 western_rifled_infantry:1 "Rifled Musketeers"
 western_rifled_infantryDESCR:1 "Smooth-bore firearms like the musket were notoriously inaccurate, often off by more than a foot at fifty yards.  This meant that musketeers had to fight in tight groups that were vulnerable to increasingly deadly artillery fire. The solution was to introduce rifled muskets that added spin to a bullet and made it fly straight, making these 'rifles' much more accurate and deadly at ranges where a regular musket would be completely ineffective. The downside was that reloading such a gun was time-consuming - a rifle could get off only one shot for every three musket balls - so riflemen were trained to fight in pairs, one shooting while the other reloaded. Although rifles had been put into use by the late eighteenth century, their cost and disadvantages made them relatively rare until much later.  Riflemen such as the Prussian Jaegers, French Voltigeurs or British Greenjackets made excellent sharpshooters and snipers, but because they fought in smaller groups were unable to protect themselves from cavalry.  Most armies maintained small numbers of riflemen in each brigade to compensate for each other's weaknesses."
 western_columnar_infantry:1 "Columnar Infantry"
 western_columnar_infantryDESCR:1 "Revolutionary France relied on conscript soldiers for the bulk of their army. To give these green troops confidence in battle they placed them in a single column that marched steadily forward towards the enemy to the beat of hundreds of drums. The column presented a thin target that could turn to form a line or dig into entrenchments that protected them from enemy attack.  The men in front would be killed by enemy fire, but eventually the men would climb over the bodies of their own dead and break through enemy lines.  Although losses could be high, columns often won against other formations through sheer stubbornness and force of numbers."
 western_impulse_infantry:1 "Impulse Infantry"
 western_impulse_infantryDESCR:1 "Impulse Infantry relied upon a 'cloud' of light infantry that acted as sharpshooters and skirmishers, keeping the enemy pinned down under fire while the main line advanced into position to charge the enemy line and deliver a coup de grace."
 western_lancer_cavalry:1 "Lancers"
 western_lancer_cavalryDESCR:1 "The creme de la creme of the Napoleonic army. Although their lances made them less agile these cavalry troops were formidable adversaries when charging their enemies directly."
 western_breech_infantry:1 "Breech Loaded Riflemen"
 western_breech_infantryDESCR:1 "Nearly all early firearms were muzzle-loaded, or loaded from the front. This made even the more advanced guns slow to reload, a critical factor in battle. The first mass-produced breech-loader (back-loaded guns) began appearing in the nineteenth century and made combat much deadlier. Where before a well-trained soldier could fire as many as four shots a minute, even a poorly trained soldier could fire faster with a breech-loaded rifle.  This had the effect of making a single soldier much deadlier than ever before."
 western_jominian_infantry:1 "Jominian Infantry"
 western_jominian_infantryDESCR:1 "As armies grew in the years following the Napoleonic Wars, so too did the need to properly deploy these armies.  One leading military thinker, Antoine-Henri Jomini, placed heavy emphasis on the concentration of troops with 'interior lines' from which it would be easy to mass power on specific points in the enemy's lines.  In practise, this led to mass charges in order to overwhelm enemy defences.  While this did have the downside of removing emphasis from firepower, many nations were distrustful of a faster rate of fire, fearing troops would expend their ammunition too quickly and flee. These tactics formed the basis of the French, Russian, Austrian, and American military schools well into the nineteenth century."
 eastern_toxotai_infantry:1 "Vasilikon Allagion"
 eastern_toxotai_infantryDESCR:1 "The vasilika allagia were the campaigning regiments of the late Byzantine army in the 13th and early 14th centuries. Each allagion was composed of soldiers funded through various institutions that had been put into place over centuries, including those still on the traditional roga and those with grants of stratiotika ktemata or pronoia. These men's equipment ranged in quality depending on how large their income was, from those who could barely afford their weapons to those who had the latest in armor fashion. One thing equalized them, however - these forces were still professionally trained Roman soldiers."
 eastern_mourtatoi_infantry:1 "Mourtatoi Archers"
 eastern_mourtatoi_infantryDESCR:1 "Supposedly the offspring of mixed marriages, Mourtatoi were Turkish Muslims who fought in the Greek style for Christian nations using bows and crossbows.  Influenced by nearby Italy and Germany, they wore heavy coats of armour.  This allowed them to launch volleys of missiles against enemies and while withstanding enemy attacks, although they were still used primarily in support roles for the cavalry."
 eastern_hospite_infantry:1 "Hospites"
 eastern_hospite_infantryDESCR:1 "Many Western Balkan states imported officers and equipment from Italy and Germany, creating units of heavily armoured foot soldiers wearing hauberks, coifs, greaves and gauntlets who fought in the Western style."
 eastern_horse_archer_cavalry:1 "Massagetoi"
 eastern_horse_archer_cavalryDESCR:1 "Massagetoi was a term used for Indo-Iranian speaking peoples in the far East during the days of Herodotus and Pliny, known as the Scythians, Sarmatians, and Alans. Vestiges of these groups remained after the influx of early Turkic peoples in the form of the Huns and Hunno-Bulgars, including the Alans who formed a new kingdom in the Caucasus. The Alans would continue to serve in the armies of the Romans, Lazicans, Georgians, and Armenians well into the 14th century, where they formed a backbone of horse archers and shock cavalry. The Caucasus peoples were famous for their helmet- and armor-smithing, and these Alans supplied men equipped at every level from scouts to cataphracts."
 eastern_mountain_nomad_cavalry:1 "Mountain Nomads"
 eastern_mountain_nomad_cavalryDESCR:1 "Many Balkan mountain people and highlanders remained semi-nomadic, and when times were tough thousands offered their services as mercenary auxiliaries.  They fought as light cavalry, riding ponies and carrying equipment acquired from any available source, although javelins were their favoured weapon.  The Albanians and Vlachs were both instrumental in the armies of Stefan Dusan's Serbian empire, for example."
 eastern_cuman_cavalry:1 "Cuman Light Cavalry"
 eastern_cuman_cavalryDESCR:1 "The Cumans who settled in Hungary served as loyal cavalrymen.  They wore mail and carried spears and bows, allowing them to be versatile in combat.  Unlike their feudal counterparts, the Cuman preferred to wear less armour, allowing them to travel faster and manoeuvre better on the battlefield."
 eastern_druzhina_cavalry:1 "Druzhina Cavalry"
 eastern_druzhina_cavalryDESCR:1 "Cavalry units equipped with battle-axes that made up the core of many eastern European armies. In peacetime the Druzhinas would most often serve as bodyguards or handle extractions of tribute."
 eastern_skoutatoi_infantry:1 "Mega Allagion"
 eastern_skoutatoi_infantryDESCR:1 "The megala allagia were the campaigning regiments of the Balkans provinces of the Byzantine empire after the loss of Anatolia, based in Salonike, Vizye, and Strymon. Like the vasilika allagia before them, these were regiments of professional Roman soldiers funded through multiple ancient and modern institutions including the roga, the stratiotika ktemata, and the pronoia. These regiments consisted of forces ranging from basic pike-armed stratiotai to officers and veterans armed in the latest Italian fashions as plate armor developed. They remained mobile, professional regiments, called up to serve the emperor on campaign in the Balkans in the last century of the empire."
 eastern_bandiera_infantry:1 "Flag Infantry"
 eastern_bandiera_infantryDESCR:1 "In the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, royal power was expanded by placing peasant armies recruited by local barons under royal control.  These 'Bandiera' or flag infantry were transformed into the core of professional armies, replacing levied bowmen with light infantry who carried crossbows and, occasionally, javelins.  There were special competitions and exercises for them in the Balkans, where these crossbowmen were the most important infantry troops of the fourteenth century.  However, they were still used primarily to attack and defend obstacles rather than fight pitched battles."
 eastern_pronoia_cavalry:1 "Pronoiarioi Medium Cavalry"
 eastern_pronoia_cavalryDESCR:1 "Pronoiarioi were veterans and bureaucrats granted revenue allotments from taxable land to fund their military activities in exchange for providing administrative oversight, who often used these funds to increase their wealth by purchasing lands of their own. Serving as officers and file leaders of the vasilika allagia and megala allagia, these men were divided in class by the number of war-horses they could afford, and served as the backbone of what remained of the 14th century Roman army. Many were armed in the latest in imported Italian fashion, and were thoroughly trained in horse archery and lancing at the military archery school in Constantinople."
 eastern_balkan_feudal_cavalry:1 "Feudal Heavy Cavalry"
 eastern_balkan_feudal_cavalryDESCR:1 "Inspired by German and Italian knights, many Balkan states maintained feudal levies of knights who wore plate mail.  These heavy cavalry were too slow to catch raiders or light cavalry, but they were powerful in battle and effective against western armies."
 eastern_hand_gunner:1 "Hand Gunner"
 eastern_hand_gunnerDESCR:1 "With the growing importance of firearms, some states trained troops to use arquebuses and matchlock muskets in battle.  No state did so more successfully than Hungary, whose famous Black Legion was made up of conscripted mercenaries from Bohemia and Germany.  The Black Legion was made up of one hand gunner for every four troops, a ratio shockingly high at a time when western armies had a ratio of one to ten.  Lightly armoured, their role was to launch surprise attacks on the enemy while the cavalry screened them from enemy charges.  Although highly effective, the cost of maintaining a permanent paid army was ruinous to the state."
 eastern_waggonberg_infantry:1 "Waggonberg Infantry"
 eastern_waggonberg_infantryDESCR:1 "As firearms became increasingly effective, novel new tactics were developed to make use of them.  Inspired by tactics used in the Hussite Wars and brought with refugees fleeing from them into the Balkans, Balkan nations developed Tabor armoured wagon trains with mounted guns that served not only as weapons, but as portable cover for armies that could be chained together to turn any battlefield into a defensive position for the army.  Hunyadi Janos famously used them in battle against the Ottomans by using the wagons in narrow valleys to bottle up enemy cavalry before flanking them with his own cavalry.  However, the wagons were of little use on the offensive and relied on cavalry to win the day against similarly defensive opponents."
 eastern_latinikon_infantry:1 "Stratiotai"
 eastern_latinikon_infantryDESCR:1 "Stratiotai were the remaining soldiers who still held grants of pronoia throughout the Balkans in the final decades of the Byzantine empire. Despite the loss of almost all of the empire's provinces, this institution was also adopted by the Serbs and Ottomans, who maintained these privileges and called these men timarli (timariots) after acquiring the territory. The stratiotai who remained in Roman service provided both their selves and local militias, and the Italians remarked that these nobles were better equipped than the Emperor's own guardsmen. Their militias, however, were poorly armed and in severe debt due to being called up to serve by their landlords instead of being able to produce grain, which caused logistical and economic turmoil in the Balkans."
 eastern_balkan_light_cavalry:1 "Ianitzaroi"
 eastern_balkan_light_cavalryDESCR:1 "The ianitzaroi were lightly armed and armored professional soldiers who served as a guard unit of the Byzantine emperors beginning in the late 14th century. Originating as a Catalan mercenary company and named after Berber tribes much like the older englinovarangoi, the Italians noted that they were a well drilled and coordinated force that fulfilled their role well. These ianitzaroi helped spread the institution to the Ottoman empire, where they were known as the yengiceri (janissaries)."
 eastern_hussar_horse_archer_cavalry:1 "Hussar Horse Archers"
 eastern_hussar_horse_archer_cavalryDESCR:1 "With the increasing dominance of light cavalry on the battlefields of Eastern Europe, the Hussar became a staple of the battlefield.  Dressed in extravagant costumes but little or no armour, they relied on bows to pick off the enemy, and their speed to avoid direct confrontation.  They began as foreign mercenaries, giving them their Polish name of Racowie, 'Serbians'.  Increasingly, however, they were named 'Hussars', after the Slavonic word for bandit."
 eastern_deli_cavalry:1 "Deli Scouts"
 eastern_deli_cavalryDESCR:1 "Known as 'hotheads', Serbian cavalry were famous for their extravagant costumes and their high morale.  They fought as irregular cavalry, but preferred to act as scouts, seeking out the enemy and returning with positions and numbers to aid in combat.  After the fall of Serbia, Deli scouts served in the armies of both the Ottoman Empire and their enemy Poland."
 eastern_draby_infantry:1 "Draby Infantry"
 eastern_draby_infantryDESCR:1 "Central European nations did not place much value on infantry, preferring to import them from Germany.  However, they did maintain armies of Draby - small contingents of pikemen who stayed among a larger force of arquebusiers, protecting them from immediate attack."
 eastern_pischalniki_infantry:1 "Arquebus Militias"
 eastern_pischalniki_infantryDESCR:1 "Many Eastern European states were slow to adopt firearms, but others made good use of them.  The Russian Pischal'niki militia carried heavy harquebus handguns into battle.  However, they were poorly trained and lightly armoured, and the harquebuses they used required them to be placed on firing stands, then removed in order to reload them.  They made use of Waggonberg mobile obstacles to protect them from enemy fire and relied on the cavalry to keep enemy forces at range."
 eastern_medium_hussar_cavalry:1 "Medium Hussars"
 eastern_medium_hussar_cavalryDESCR:1 "Hussars were light cavalry who fought in the style of bandits.  At first they served in a support role, moving faster than a heavy armoured knight could.  Later, they began replacing them.  These medium hussars wore mail armour and carried lances.  The horses had to be well-bred and well-trained, costing as much as ten years salary for their rider."
 eastern_cossack_cavalry:1 "Cossack Raiders"
 eastern_cossack_cavalryDESCR:1 "The Russians, Poles and Hungarians found themselves at a disadvantage against Mongol cavalry along the Steppe.  They were fast and manoeuvrable enough to avoid Russian counterattacks.  Often, the best defence against them was to bribe or coerce Cossack nomads into fighting against their own kin.  Soon, Cossack raiders became in demand as hardy, if undisciplined, horsemen.  These light cavalry carried lances and bows and lived off the land."
 eastern_pomeste_cavalry:1 "Pomeste Cavalry"
 eastern_pomeste_cavalryDESCR:1 "A pomestie was land held by the gentry in exchange for a lifetime of military service.  Each pomestie and its peasant families was expected to supply one cavalryman and two horses when demanded.  The Pomeste cavalry that was raised in this manner was dramatically expanded under Ivan IV to become the backbone of the Russian army.  Pomeste carried spears, sabres and pistols, but their chief weapon was the bow, which they used in hit-and-run strikes.  Although they wore chain mail, they served as light cavalry.  Having learned from previous attempts to employ a feudal cavalry, the Russians also demanded that the Pomeste muster once a year to compare them to tax records."
 eastern_streltsy_infantry:1 "Strel'tsy Musketeers"
 eastern_streltsy_infantryDESCR:1 "Rather than rely on mercenaries, Ivan IV created a permanent professional army called Strel'tsy ('Shooters').  Unlike previous forces, the Strel'tsy were armed and dressed uniformly, well-trained, and paid on a regular basis.  This made them loyal and effective troops.  They were armed with arquebuses, and later with muskets.  In battle, they were placed in the middle of the line and fired from a stationary position at the enemy, relying on the cavalry to protect them.  In close combat, they switched to the heavy, two-handed axes that gave them a fearsome reputation.  But what made them different from regular troops was not their armament or tactics, but the fact that military service in the Strel'tsy was lifelong and hereditary.  This created an elite class of professional soldier, but also bred resentment in the rest of the army."
 eastern_marauder_infantry:1 "Marauder Infantry"
 eastern_marauder_infantryDESCR:1 "As firearms became more effective, Draby infantry were replaced with haiduks (marauders).  They were reputed to be large, fierce men who lived life roughly, and they were armed almost entirely with arquebuses and axes, with only one in ten carrying a pike.  Their role in combat was to support the cavalry, or for defending or attacking obstacles.  Only rarely were they called upon to fight hand-to-hand, and they did poorly against cavalry.  Despite these flaws, they became the standard infantry of Hungary and Poland.  By the mid-seventeenth century, it was clear they also did poorly against more balanced pike and shot formations, and they were phased out."
 eastern_drabant_infantry:1 "Drabant Guards"
 eastern_drabant_infantryDESCR:1 "Believing Western infantry to be superior, many Eastern European nations hired soldiers and mercenaries from the West to train their infantry, or even to make up entire regiments of men.  Drabant infantry were German and Czech soldiers originally hired as elite royal guards such as the Polish Footguards.  They fought in the western style, with halberds and matchlock muskets in equal numbers."
 eastern_light_cossack_cavalry:1 "Light Cossacks"
 eastern_light_cossack_cavalryDESCR:1 "Early Cossack cavalry were raised from Zaporozhian Cossacks and Tatar refugees, but as it showed its value on the battlefield, increasingly gentry cavalrymen took to the style regardless of their ethnicity.  By the end of the sixteenth century, they had replaced their bows with carbines, and like the French Caracole, they were adept at shooting their pistols.  Unlike the Caracole, however, they maintained their distance from the enemy, preferring to avoid charges and hand-to-hand combat in favour of ranged combat and skirmishing."
 eastern_light_hussar:1 "Light Hussars"
 eastern_light_hussarDESCR:1 "In Hungary, hussar cavalry became increasingly light, giving up armour entirely in order to emphasise speed and manoeuvrability on the battlefield.  At the same time, their costumes became increasingly extravagant, inspiring poets to claim they were the most beautiful horsemen in the world.  Military observers were much more interested in their effectiveness on the battlefield against the Ottomans, something that did not escape the attention of western Europe.  The light hussar soon spread to the West, where it influenced cavalry tactics for a century."
 eastern_slavic_western_infantry:1 "Slavic Western infantry"
 eastern_slavic_western_infantryDESCR:1 "Despite the success of Western style infantry on the battlefield, Eastern European nations were slow to train their own subjects to fight in a similar manner, instead preferring to hire foreigners.  The heavy demand for such mercenaries during the Thirty Years War prompted some states to break with this tradition, raising armies of westernised Slavs who fought with matchlock muskets, much to the displeasure of nobles who worried this could lead to well-armed peasant revolts."
 eastern_grenadier_infantry:1 "Grenadiers"
 eastern_grenadier_infantryDESCR:1 "Although Eastern Europeans were slow to adopt firearms, specialised troops known as Grenadiers defied this trend.  Replacing the more common matchlock muskets with more modern flintlocks, they fought with shot, bayonet and grenade, capable of stopping a cavalry charge."
 eastern_soldaty_infantry:1 "Soldaty Charge Infantry"
 eastern_soldaty_infantryDESCR:1 "A shift in tactics occurred as firearms became deadlier.  Instead of supporting the cavalry, Russian Soldaty infantry took the offensive by combining muskets and halberds to take the battle to the enemy."
 eastern_pancerni_cavalry:1 "Pancerni Medium Cavalry"
 eastern_pancerni_cavalryDESCR:1 "After the rebellion of the Cossacks, Cossack cavalry no longer had any relationship to true Cossacks.  Instead, it was renamed Pancerni, or 'mail-coated' medium cavalry.  They were extremely mobile cavalry who could be elusive when outnumbered.  They preferred close combat weapons such as swords over the long lances used by hussars, but when confronted with pikemen they were capable of firing with carbine pistols or bows from range instead.  Most came from the gentry."
 eastern_heavy_hussar:1 "Heavy Hussars"
 eastern_heavy_hussarDESCR:1 "Hussar cavalry proved to be very effective.  As time went on, Polish hussars increasingly served as heavy cavalry, wearing plate cuirasses in order to protect them in hand-to-hand combat and against missiles.  They carried lances, sabres and long swords, and could launch a devastating charge against enemy lines."
 eastern_reiter_cavalry:1 "Reiter Heavy Cavalry"
 eastern_reiter_cavalryDESCR:1 "Known as Reiters in Germany and Ratjars in Poland, these cavalrymen fought in Western fashion as cuirassieurs, lancers and arquebusiers.  They rode heavy warhorses and wore three-quarter armour.  Although not as famous as Eastern hussars and Cossack cavalry, after the Polish disaster at Batoh, they supplanted hussars for over a decade."
 eastern_platoon_infantry:1 "Platoon Fire Musketeers"
 eastern_platoon_infantryDESCR:1 "Bayonets were introduced in the mid-seventeenth century and were gradually refined and made more reliable.  Throughout the seventeenth century tactics remained the same: musketeers advanced slowly on the enemy, pausing to fire volleys at them in an attempt to break the enemy line, allowing cavalry to pursue and mop up the scattered enemy.  When this failed, a bayonet charge and hand-to-hand combat was necessary.  This tactic gradually made pikemen superfluous on the battlefield, and where there had been three pikemen to every musketeer by the beginning of the century, there were five musketeers to every pikemen by its end.  Scottish Highlanders were known for being willing to charge the enemy just as much as to shoot at them."
 eastern_regular_infantry:1 "Musketeer Regulars"
 eastern_regular_infantryDESCR:1 "Bayonets were introduced in the mid-seventeenth century and were gradually refined and made more reliable.  Throughout the seventeenth century tactics remained the same: musketeers advanced slowly on the enemy, pausing to fire volleys at them in an attempt to break the enemy line, allowing cavalry to pursue and mop up the scattered enemy.  When this failed, a bayonet charge and hand-to-hand combat was necessary.  This tactic gradually made pikemen superfluous on the battlefield, and where there had been three pikemen to every musketeer by the beginning of the century, there were five musketeers to every pikemen by its end.  British Redcoats used their bayonets to keep the enemy at bay while picking them off with musket fire."
 eastern_carabinier_cavalry:1 "Carabiniers"
 eastern_carabinier_cavalryDESCR:1 "The Carabiniers first came into being in the late sixteenth century and were a type of heavy cavalry that had many things in common with Cuirassiers. They also wore protective armour, though slightly less than a Cuirassier. The main difference between the two cavalry forces was their armament. A Carabinier's main weapon was the carbine, a short wheellock handgun. In addition to the carbine, they were also armed with a sword."
 eastern_armeblanche_cavalry:1 "Arme Blanche Cavalry"
 eastern_armeblanche_cavalryDESCR:1 "While the hussar Cavalry represented the balance between fire and shock and the Dragoon cavalry relied primarily on their muskets, Arme Blanche cavalry relied primarily on cold steel. The bold charges of these units could shatter enemy formations."
 eastern_bayonet_infantry:1 "Bayonet Infantry"
 eastern_bayonet_infantryDESCR:1 "The use of volley tactics, the introduction of safer, more reliable flintlock muskets and the use of bayonets in close combat eliminated the need for pikemen on the battlefield by the turn of the eighteenth century, and soon new tactics were developed to suit.  Now that musketeers had reliable bayonets, infantry charges were once again a viable strategy in battle, allowing them to once again claim the initiative on the battlefield."
 eastern_line_infantry:1 "Line Infantry"
 eastern_line_infantryDESCR:1 "The use of volley tactics, the introduction of safer, more reliable flintlock muskets and the use of bayonets in close combat eliminated the need for pikemen on the battlefield by the turn of the eighteenth century.  Soon afterwards, new tactics were developed to suit this reality.  The most popular and arguably most effective tactic was to form a thin line facing the enemy so that musketeers could inflict maximum casualties on the enemy and react quickly to enemy movement. This also allowed for specialised soldiers to appear along the line such as the grenadier."
 eastern_skirmisher_infantry:1 "Irregular Skirmishers"
 eastern_skirmisher_infantryDESCR:1 "Standing armies were small, and even in the seventeenth century levies were called upon during wartime to make up the bulk of the army. These conscript troops did not have the training or discipline of regulars and were often distrusted by their commanders. With more accurate and faster guns making pike screens unnecessary, some commanders began using these men as irregular infantry who operated as marksmen and skirmishers in small units around the main army. These irregular skirmishers could help scout unfamiliar terrain, pin down enemy units until the main force could arrive, and best of all, were expendable. Austria in particular made great use of their 'Grenzers', who made up over a quarter of the Austrian army."
 eastern_hunter_cavalry:1 "Hunter Cavalry"
 eastern_hunter_cavalryDESCR:1 "Hunter cavalry were lightly armoured units trained for rapid action.  They specialised in skirmishes and were renowned for their shooting skills.  They proved so useful during the shifting lines of battle that the French army developed these 'Chasseur à Cheval' into a significant part of their cavalry."
 eastern_uhlan_cavalry:1 "Uhlans"
 eastern_uhlan_cavalryDESCR:1 "The first Uhlans were created in the early eighteenth century. They were used primarily for reconnaissance for the more heavily armoured cavalry, as well as being assigned to skirmishes. Later on they became an essential part of the military structure due to their light armour, making them fast and agile on the battlefield, and for their high shock value against their enemies.  Uhlan cavalry were a good alternative to large infantry armies as they were not only heavy hitting but also more cost effective. This allowed smaller nations with less manpower to actually put up an effective fight, as armies on foot were also slower compared to their mounted counterparts."
 eastern_drill_infantry:1 "Drill Infantry"
 eastern_drill_infantryDESCR:1 "Able to fight at close range or from further away, musketeers were versatile indeed - but only if they could react quickly to the shifting battlefield. Frederick of Prussia trained his men rigorously to deal with any situation that could conceivably come up until they became an incredible fighting force that never broke ranks and could fire as much as one shot every fifteen seconds under combat conditions!  This Prussian Drill infantry became the model army for the rest of the world after its stunning successes in battle and was used by both sides in the American Revolution."
 eastern_mass_infantry:1 "Mass Infantry"
 eastern_mass_infantryDESCR:1 "A favourite of the Russians, highly drilled Mass Infantry could be relied on to charge while under fire without breaking, resulting in terrible casualties for the enemy if it succeeded in reaching enemy lines. The bayonet and constant drill brought back the charge tactic in force: mass infantry launched a devastating volley of fire at their enemy, then set their bayonets and charged.  The result could be deadly to their enemies when it succeeded - or deadly to their own side if it failed."
 eastern_rifled_infantry:1 "Rifled Musketeers"
 eastern_rifled_infantryDESCR:1 "Smooth-bore firearms like the musket were notoriously inaccurate, often off by more than a foot at fifty yards.  This meant that musketeers had to fight in tight groups that were vulnerable to increasingly deadly artillery fire. The solution was to introduce rifled muskets that added spin to a bullet and made it fly straight, making these 'rifles' much more accurate and deadly at ranges where a regular musket would be completely ineffective. The downside was that reloading such a gun was time-consuming - a rifle could get off only one shot for every three musket balls - so riflemen were trained to fight in pairs, one shooting while the other reloaded. Although rifles had been put into use by the late eighteenth century, their cost and disadvantages made them relatively rare until much later.  Riflemen such as the Prussian Jaegers, French Voltigeurs or British Greenjackets made excellent sharpshooters and snipers, but because they fought in smaller groups were unable to protect themselves from cavalry.  Most armies maintained small numbers of riflemen in each brigade to compensate for each other's weaknesses."
 eastern_columnar_infantry:1 "Columnar Infantry"
 eastern_columnar_infantryDESCR:1 "Revolutionary France relied on conscript soldiers for the bulk of their army. To give these green troops confidence in battle they placed them in a single column that marched steadily forward towards the enemy to the beat of hundreds of drums. The column presented a thin target that could turn to form a line or dig in to entrenchments that protected them from enemy attack.  The men in front would be killed by enemy fire, but eventually the men would climb over the bodies of their own dead and break through enemy lines.  Although losses could be high, columns often won against other formations through sheer stubbornness and force of numbers."
 eastern_impulse_infantry:1 "Impulse Infantry"
 eastern_impulse_infantryDESCR:1 "Impulse Infantry relied upon a 'cloud' of light infantry that acted as sharpshooters and skirmishers, keeping the enemy pinned down under fire while the main line advanced into position to charge the enemy line and deliver a coup de grace."
 eastern_lancer_cavalry:1 "Lancers"
 eastern_lancer_cavalryDESCR:1 "The creme de la creme of the Napoleonic army. Although their lances made them less agile these cavalry troops were formidable adversaries when charging their enemies directly."
 eastern_breech_infantry:1 "Breech Loaded Riflemen"
 eastern_breech_infantryDESCR:1 "Nearly all early firearms were muzzle-loaded, or loaded from the front. This made even the more advanced guns slow to reload, a critical factor in battle. The first mass-produced breech-loader (back-loaded guns) began appearing in the nineteenth century and made combat much deadlier. Where before a well-trained soldier could fire as many as four shots a minute, even a poorly trained soldier could fire faster with a breech-loaded rifle.  This had the effect of making a single soldier much deadlier than ever before."
 eastern_jominian_infantry:1 "Jominian Infantry"
 eastern_jominian_infantryDESCR:1 "As armies grew in the years following the Napoleonic Wars, so too did the need to properly deploy these armies.  One leading military thinker, Antoine-Henri Jomini, placed heavy emphasis on the concentration of troops with 'interior lines' from which it would be easy to mass power on specific points in the enemy's lines.  In practise, this led to mass charges in order to overwhelm enemy defences.  While this did have the downside of removing emphasis from firepower, many nations were distrustful of a faster rate of fire, fearing troops would expend their ammunition too quickly and flee. These tactics formed the basis of the French, Russian, Austrian, and American military schools well into the nineteenth century."
 muslim_mashain_walker_infantry:1 "Mashain Walkers"
 muslim_mashain_walker_infantryDESCR:1 "Infantry troops who trained to fight defensively, Mashain walkers fought in formation, with the outer ranks carrying spears and pikes, the middle ranks holding shields and javelins, and the inner ranks made up of slingers and archers.  With Mashain tactics, the cavalry's role was to support the infantry, remaining in the centre of the formation ready to charge through any holes exposed by the enemy.  Although Mashain tactics were the hallmark of earlier North African empires, they continued to be used by their successor states for some time."
 muslim_arab_horseman:1 "Arab Horsemen"
 muslim_arab_horsemanDESCR:1 "In the Arab tradition, horsemen fought wearing mail hauberks and leather shields and fighting from horseback with spears.  This style of fighting was popular across North Africa as well as Arabia.  They often served for pay during campaigns, then returned to the deserts when unneeded.  They could also guard roads, transport provisions and act as messengers for the army."
 muslim_armored_infantry:1 "Heavy Infantry"
 muslim_armored_infantryDESCR:1 "Slow-moving infantry wearing mail hauberks and carrying axes.  These troops were found in areas that faced similar heavy infantry, such as the Nasrid Emirate of Granada."
 muslim_faris_cavalry:1 "Faris Heavy Cavalry"
 muslim_faris_cavalryDESCR:1 "Like the Crusaders they fought against, Muslim cavalrymen often wore heavy armour including a full mail hauberk and shield.  They carried lances, but unlike their Christian counterparts, preferred fighting with composite bows and curved swords.  Since their swords were unable to cut through enemy armour, they targeted enemy horses instead."
 muslim_rajjala_infantry:1 "Rajjala Light Infantry"
 muslim_rajjala_infantryDESCR:1 "Professional footsoldiers who first saw combat in 1275 against the Crusaders, Rajjala were mostly used for sieges and town defence, but also slew friendly cavalry who tried to flee the battle in order to encourage the cavalry to stand and fight.  They were mostly archers and arbalesters, lightly armoured and not much use in hand-to-hand combat."
 muslim_halqa_irregular_infantry:1 "Harfush Irregulars"
 muslim_halqa_irregular_infantryDESCR:1 "Harfush, or 'rabble', were auxiliary infantry that were used in siege and mountain warfare.  They were often taken from the ranks of defeated enemies or unemployed soldiers who accepted an offer to join the military.  They had to provide their own arms and living quarters, and maintained their original command structure.  Both of these traits resulted in incredible variation in quality.  However, their ranks swelled the army, and by institutionalizing them, it prevented them from becoming the focal point of rebellions and gave peasants something to aspire to."
 muslim_amir_mamluk_cavalry:1 "Amir's Mamluk Cavalry"
 muslim_amir_mamluk_cavalryDESCR:1 "Mamluks were slave soldiers, captured as children from Turkish lands to serve as soldiers.  The Amir's Mamluks made up the majority of their ranks, belonging to units that were out of favour, raised by provincial Amirs, or having been recruited by past Sultans.  These Amir Mamluks received lower pay and worse equipment and training than the elite Royal Mamluks, but were still a formidable force.  They wore mail armour and carried spears, maces and daggers.  They were trained to make feigned retreats, flank the enemy, and loose arrows at him."
 ottoman_akinci_light_cavalry:1 "Akinci Light Cavalry"
 ottoman_akinci_light_cavalryDESCR:1 "With the Mongol success in Asia, Turcoman nomads were forced out of their traditional lands and sought refuge among their Turkish cousins.  They often served in Turkish armies as horse-archers, fighting in the Mongol style with swords, lassos and bows.  Some wore lamellar cuirasses.  Although fierce, they were not able to capture towns or enemy fortifications, so they were used primarily as raiders and scouts.  When an entire tribe served in this manner, they were called Yorouks."
 ottoman_ghazi_infantry:1 "Ghazi Warriors"
 ottoman_ghazi_infantryDESCR:1 "Inspired by their faith to fight a holy war against the infidel, thousands of volunteers came from across Islam to the frontiers with heathens.  The Turks were able to take advantage of this to recruit them into their army, where they served as mixed forces.  They followed a personal code of honour and wore distinctive white felt caps."
 ottoman_azap_infantry:1 "Azap Archers"
 ottoman_azap_infantryDESCR:1 "Azaps were light infantry whose task was to keep enemy forces at bay with their bows until regular troops had gotten into formation.  They were conscript troops called up during a campaign, then returned to their homes.  The Azaps were divided into Deniz Azaps (Marines) and Kale Azaps (Garrison troops)."
 ottoman_musellem_cavalry:1 "Musellem Cavalry"
 ottoman_musellem_cavalryDESCR:1 "Musellem, or 'tax-free' cavalry, was developed as a way to provide the Turks with their own cavalry army.  In return for military service, Musellem received small fiefs from their loyal bey, who in turn was responsible for leading a hundred or thousand horsemen in battle.  While the system was successful in creating a permanent army, it led to regional governors having command of armies and the Musellems were gradually relegated to second-line duties."
 ottoman_yaya_infantry:1 "Yaya Infantry"
 ottoman_yaya_infantryDESCR:1 "Mercenary footsoldier archers who carried bows and crossbows and wore heavy coats of armour.  This allowed them to launch volleys of missiles against enemies and while withstanding enemy attacks, although they were used primarily in support roles for the cavalry."
 muslim_halqa_regular_infantry:1 "Halqa Regulars"
 muslim_halqa_regular_infantryDESCR:1 "Halqa were freeborn soldiers who fought as infantry.  When they were used as the primary soldiers of a nation, Halqa were rewarded with large fiefs (iqta) which were passed down through military families, maintaining unit cohesion and training.  They wore mail or lamellar armour and carried axes and maces.  These Halqa were effective troops who fought for pay and to defend their families."
 muslim_incendiary_infantry:1 "Jandar Infantry"
 muslim_incendiary_infantryDESCR:1 "First used against Iberian Christians, then later against the Mongols, incendiary infantry used flaming arrows, firecrackers (sawarikh), Greek fire (naft), grenades and handheld cannons (midfa) to frighten enemy horses, which were often the main enemy force.  They wore thick black woolen cloth coated with fire-proof talc to protect themselves from burns and carried swords in order to fight at close quarters.  However, they suffered from a limited range and duration of their weapons, and saw only limited use in combat."
 muslim_crossbow_infantry:1 "Crossbowmen"
 muslim_crossbow_infantryDESCR:1 "Needing to fight at sea as well as on land, the Muslims of North Africa developed marine crossbowmen who could use their weapons well in both theatres.  They carried crossbows, swords and daggers, and wore light armour with weatherproof cloaks."
 muslim_ghuzat_infantry:1 "Ghuzat Infantry"
 muslim_ghuzat_infantryDESCR:1 "Ghazi or Ghuzat, as they were known in North Africa, were volunteers who saw jihad as a religious obligation.  They often travelled great distances to join the armies of nations along the frontiers of Islam, such as Nasrid Granada.  They were mostly crossbowmen who wore mail hauberks, and despite their high morale, were not always disciplined troops."
 muslim_jinete_cavalry:1 "Jinete Light Cavalry"
 muslim_jinete_cavalryDESCR:1 "During the Reconquista, both Muslims and Christians made use of Jinete - horsemen who lived along the border who made their living by raiding the enemy.  Armed with javelins, light lances and broad bladed swords who wore only cuirasses and helmets, they were fast and manoeuvrable cavalry who used Moorish tactics on the battlefield.  They harassed the enemy, launching javelins and keeping their distance until the enemy ranks fell into disorder, then charged with their light lances.  Another tactic was to feign retreat, then lure the enemy into a trap.  They were also used by both sides to raid and to hunt down enemy raiders.  The Spanish continued to make use of them even after the Reconquista ended, making up from one third to two thirds of all cavalry."
 muslim_royal_mamluk_cavalry:1 "Royal Mamluk Cavalry"
 muslim_royal_mamluk_cavalryDESCR:1 "Mamluks were slave soldiers, captured as children from Turkish lands and trained in military schools to become elite soldiers before being freed by the Sultan, whose personal army was called the Royal Mamluks.  They wore lamellar or mail armour and carried heavy lances, swords, maces, composite bows and crossbows.  They relied on mobility, discipline, and the ability to fight both at range and at close quarters.  If the enemy charged, they would loose arrows while at rest, then scatter.  A trained Mamluk was said to be able to loose three arrows in one and a half seconds!  Once the enemy was slowed down from its wounds, they would attack, aiming at standard bearers and drummers especially to disrupt enemy communications.  A favourite tactic was to feign retreat and then flank the enemy.  Royal Mamluks participated in an intense daily regimen of polo, archery, fencing and wrestling in order to stay in shape."
 muslim_mongol_cavalry:1 "Mongol Cavalry"
 muslim_mongol_cavalryDESCR:1 "The success of the Mongols in Asia sent thousands of Turks and Turkoman Muslims fleeing into Muslim lands.  These freeborn soldiers were welcomed into the armies of nations such as Egypt, Persia and Arabia, where they fought in their traditional style of horse archers."
 ottoman_voyniq_heavy_infantry:1 "Voyniq Heavy Infantry"
 ottoman_voyniq_heavy_infantryDESCR:1 "When a heathen country was conquered by Muslims, their existing military elites were often incorporated into the conquering army, allowing them to keep fiefs they owned in exchange for serving their new masters in the same way.  Christian knights in the Balkans and former Rhomaioi empire often accepted Islam in order to maintain their former positions in society, willingly serving as shock troops for their new overlords.  This not only created a military fighting force, it also helped to encourage the locals to accept the new religion."

 ottoman_bashi_bazouk_infantryDESCR:1 "Unpaid infantry who fought alongside the army in hopes of gaining a share of the loot.  Because of their lack of discipline, they were not used in major military operations, instead performing the roles of reconnaissance, outpost duty, and skirmishing."
 ottoman_janissary_infantry:1 "Janissary Infantry"
 ottoman_janissary_infantryDESCR:1 "Upon capturing a major heathen city, the Turks would enslave its inhabitants.  They would serve on farms, learning Turkish and the Muslim faith, then would be conscripted into the army.  After the capture of Edirne swelled their ranks to unheard of levels, the Sultan formally created the Janissary slave corps.  At first, their organisation was inspired by the Ghazi warriors who made up early Turkish armies, but over time, they began to develop their own military organisation and culture.  They were paid a monthly salary and lived in barracks, promoted by seniority and retired with pensions.  They fought with bows, slings, crossbows and javelins, and were famous for their discipline and morale.  They wore distinctive white felt caps which showed their origins as holy warriors."
 ottoman_derbent_cavalry:1 "Derbent Light Cavalry"
 ottoman_derbent_cavalryDESCR:1 "The Akinci were useful cavalry, but their limited numbers were a liability that would eventually be their undoing.  As the Turks expanded, they began to include other tribes and conquered heathens as auxiliary cavalry to expand their army, including Anatolian and Yorouk tribesmen and eventually Crimean Tatars.  These tribesmen fought from horseback with lances and bows, but were not a disciplined fighting force and were not always completely loyal.  Despite these flaws, they made up a significant part of the Turkish army."
 muslim_rammaha_lancer_cavalry:1 "Rammaha Lancers"
 muslim_rammaha_lancer_cavalryDESCR:1 "By the fifteenth century, slave cavalry had adopted heavy lances and horse armour like their European counterparts, allowing them to make devastating charges and fight in close quarters with their heavy sabres and maces."
 muslim_qizilbash_cavalry:1 "Qizilbash Cavalry"
 muslim_qizilbash_cavalryDESCR:1 "Tribal nomads, the Qizilbash were lifelong warriors who trained in the sword, lance, mace and bow.  This made them fearsome foes who were also familiar with the landscape.  They wore distinctive red and gold striped headgear, giving them their name of 'red heads' (Qizilbash)."
 ottoman_sipahi_cavalry:1 "Sipahi Timariots"
 ottoman_sipahi_cavalryDESCR:1 "The Musellem system was expanded in the early fifteenth century, becoming the majority of most Ottoman armies.  An ordinary fief (timar) supported a single horseman (timariot), while larger fiefs were expected to bring light cavalry retainers (jebels) with them to war.  The key part of this system was that the timars were held in trust by their holders, who could not pass them down to their children.  Most Sipahi timariots wore no armour and carried light weaponry, but their morale and horsemanship was said to be among the highest."
 ottoman_janissary_arquebusier_infantry:1 "Janissary Arquebusiers"
 ottoman_janissary_arquebusier_infantryDESCR:1 "Having faced defeats at the hand of Christian arquebusiers and Mamluk cavalry, Janissaries began to adopt firearms of their own throughout the fifteenth century.  However, unlike their European counterparts, Turkish arquebusiers tended to fire at the enemy, then charge straight at them."
 ottoman_topchis_infantry:1 "Topchis Infantry"
 ottoman_topchis_infantryDESCR:1 "The Janissaries were slow to adopt new weapons or tactics, so the Sultan created an entirely new corps called the Topchis.  These were peasants, recruited into the army and trained to become musketeers.  Unlike the Janissaries and Sipahis, they were paid troops rather than feudal ones - but because of this, were only called upon during wartime.  As a result, they were scattered across the empire and needed to be reassembled and retrained whenever a campaign was launched."
 muslim_elchee_infantry:1 "Elchee Infantry"
 muslim_elchee_infantryDESCR:1 "Although they could be resolute foes, many Christians had no problem accepting Muslim coin.  European mercenaries, prisoners and converts to Islam brought their expertise with guns and cannons with them, fighting alongside Muslim armies, training their troops, and even founding Christian towns in Muslim territory.  They fought just as hard as their Muslim counterparts, knowing they would receive no mercy from Christian soldiers."
 muslim_ghulam_infantry:1 "Ghulam Archers"
 muslim_ghulam_infantryDESCR:1 "Slave archers who used two-foot bows and wore light armour, they were often displaced slaves who were extremely loyal to the state for providing their livelihood.  This made them an excellent counterbalance to cavalry, who were often tribes who brought their politics alongside their warriors.  In Persia, the Safavid Shahs attempted to displace the Qizilbash with Ghulams.  In Egypt, they were a cheaper variety of Mamluk."
 ottoman_kapikulu_cavalry:1 "Kapikulu Cavalry"
 ottoman_kapikulu_cavalryDESCR:1 "In an attempt to limit the power of the provinces, a national army called the Kapikulu was founded that was paid directly by the Sultan.  Promising young slaves taken as tribute would be sent to learn language, religion, science, athletics, leadership and combat training, then would be rewarded with service in the Kapikulu.  Under later Sultans, this program was expanded dramatically by taking fiefs (timars) away from the provincial armies and giving them to the Kapikulu instead.  As the cavalry arm of the Janissary corps, the Kapikulu held a high status in the army."
 ottoman_tabur_infantry:1 "Tabur Infantry"
 ottoman_tabur_infantryDESCR:1 "Campaigns in Hungary and the Balkans brought the Ottomans into contact with Tabur (Tabor, or Hussite) infantry tactics.  Pioneered in the Hussite Wars of Central Europe, this involved the use of top-arabalari armoured gun wagons which could be chained together to form mobile barricades.  This provided cover for arquebusiers in order to hold their own against cavalry.  The drawback of Tabur armies was their focus on defensiveness - wagons were not much use on the offensive, and needed cavalry to take the battle to the enemy."
 muslim_arquebusier:1 "Arquebusiers"
 muslim_arquebusierDESCR:1 "As they faced gunpowder weapons in their enemies, Muslim nations began to adopt the weapons themselves, sometimes brought by Europeans hoping to divide Muslims against each other.  These early arquebusiers were found from Morocco to Persia."
 muslim_qoorchilar_cavalry:1 "Qoorchilar Guards"
 muslim_qoorchilar_cavalryDESCR:1 "Qoorchilar were the royal guard, an elite drawn from the ranks of tribal Qizilbash cavalry.  They were known to be resolute, brave and highly disciplined horsemen who fought with the curved shamshir sword.  They also carried spears and muskets, allowing them to be versatile on the battlefield."
 muslim_reformed_qizilbash_cavalry:1 "Qizilbash Heavy Cavalry"
 muslim_reformed_qizilbash_cavalryDESCR:1 "As the Qizilbash became more of a standard army rather than tribal units, they began to wear helmets and armour, helping to make them stronger in hand-to-hand combat.  They continued to fight with their traditional swords, lances, maces and bows."
 muslim_tofangchi_musketeer_infantry:1 "Tofangchi Musketeers"
 muslim_tofangchi_musketeer_infantryDESCR:1 "Attempting to break the power of tribal cavalry, some Muslim rulers began recruiting local peasants, arming them with muskets and giving them horses so that they could travel long distances quickly in order to reach the enemy or leave camp quietly.  However, Tofangchi soldiers fought as infantry, massing their fire against enemy lines.  They came from hardy peasant stock, making them tough soldiers but also making them low status troops, the last refuge of the professional soldier."
 ottoman_suvareleri_cavalry:1 "Suvareleri Cavalry"
 ottoman_suvareleri_cavalryDESCR:1 "As part of the Devshirme system, a tax on heathens provided a supply of young slaves for the army and bureaucracy (Janissaries).  Mounted slave soldiers who went through the Devshirme system of training were called Suvarileri, and were considered an elite force answerable only to the Sultan.  They were loyal, professional soldiers who fought from horseback with muskets and lances and made up the backbone of Ottoman cavalry for some time."
 ottoman_sekban_infantry:1 "Sekban Infantry"
 ottoman_sekban_infantryDESCR:1 "Sekbans were irregular troops raised with a special tax to supplement the regular army during times of war.  Originally these troops were little more than rabble, but as time went on, they began to use muskets to fight, and by the end of the sixteenth century were a match for the Janissaries in battle.  The Sultans began to rely on them to counter the influence of the Janissaries at court.  However, the weakness of the Sekban was that they were paid by a special levy only during campaigns.  During peacetime, some turned to banditry."
 ottoman_janissary_musketeer_infantry:1 "Janissary Musketeers"
 ottoman_janissary_musketeer_infantryDESCR:1 "By the end of the sixteenth century, the Sultan had implemented major reforms of the army in an attempt to modernise it.  One of his initiatives was to introduce matchlock muskets as the primary weapon of the Janissaries.  The Tufenk matchlock muskets used by the Turks were longer and fired heavier bullets than their European equivalents."
 ottoman_reformed_sipahi_cavalry:1 "Calvinist Sipahi Timariots"
 ottoman_reformed_sipahi_cavalryDESCR:1 "Despite losses on the battlefield, it was only around the seventeenth century that the Sipahi finally adopted firearms, carrying pistols with them onto the battlefield.  The weapons were seen as unchivalrous by the Sipahi, who valued their long traditions.  However, the addition of firearms was undeniably effective.  They wore mail and plate armour and carried two swords in addition to a pair of pistols."
 muslim_jazayerchi_musketeer_infantry:1 "Jazayerchi Musketeers"
 muslim_jazayerchi_musketeer_infantryDESCR:1 "These elite troops carried a heavy musket that required a tripod to fire, making them slow but powerful weapons.  They were also armed with curved shamshir swords for close combat, but preferred to fight at range.  They trained for three hours a day to become excellent sharpshooters."
 ottoman_deli_light_cavalry:1 "Deli Light Cavalry"
 ottoman_deli_light_cavalryDESCR:1 "A series of defeats led to the disbandment of the Akincis.  Their role as scouts and messengers was taken over by the Deli light cavalry.  At first, Delis were predominantly made up of converts to Islam from conquered peoples.  With their knowledge of local terrain they proved invaluable to occupation forces, but they were seen as traitors to their own people and faced a painful death if caught by their countrymen.  In return, they could be brutal against their former comrades.  Their name probably comes from the Turkish word Delil, or guide, but they were commonly called Deli, or mad, because of their fearsome appearance."
 ottoman_tufek_musketeer_infantry:1 "Tufekci Musketeers"
 ottoman_tufek_musketeer_infantryDESCR:1 "During the seventeenth century it became apparent that attempts to reform the Janissaries and Timariots were doomed.  The Sultan made the decision to copy the success of Christian armies and their heavy emphasis on firepower.  Bringing in European experts, he trained a new army of Musketeers to rival the Janissaries, fighting along European lines.  Their Tufenk matchlock muskets were larger, more accurate, and slower to fire than their European equivalents."
 muslim_zanbourak_camel_cavalry:1 "Zanbourak Camelry"
 muslim_zanbourak_camel_cavalryDESCR:1 "Inspired by the Arab tradition of mounting heavy crossbows on camels, later armies began mounting gunpowder weapons on them instead.  These camel-mounted guns were inaccurate and had short ranges, but were highly manoeuvrable on the battlefield.  They could be deployed far forward on the battlefield and famously caused panic and disorder in enemy forces who were not expecting this kind of attack."
 muslim_piyadegan_infantry:1 "Piyadegan Heavy Infantry"
 muslim_piyadegan_infantryDESCR:1 "The Piyadegan were developed in tandem with heavy artillery.  Armed with spears, swords, daggers, maces and axes, they would charge into enemy lines after the artillery had made a hole for them.  While waiting for this kind of opening, they would use composite bows against enemy troops."
 muslim_gharachoorlooha_musketeer_infantry:1 "Gharachoorlooha Musketeers"
 muslim_gharachoorlooha_musketeer_infantryDESCR:1 "Light musketeers who loaded their gunpowder with a horn, allowing them to vary how much powder to use.  This gave them more control over the range of their shots, but also slowed down their rate of fire.  To compensate for this weakness, they were drilled in line firing.  They were very effective against cavalry.  At close range, they would switch to shamshir swords instead."
 muslim_savaran_saltani_cavalry:1 "Savaran Heavy Cavalry"
 muslim_savaran_saltani_cavalryDESCR:1 "Savaran e Saltani cavalry was a heavy cavalry who specialised in close-quarter combat.  Paid for directly by the ruler, they were willing to risk their mounts in combat.  They wore mail and plate armour and spiked helmets to stop enemy swords.  They fought with swords and spears, but also carried muskets.  The most famous Savaran were the Qizilbash e Naderi of Persia, introduced as a result of Nader Shah's reforms of the Qizilbash."
 ottoman_panduk_sharpshooter_infantry:1 "Panduk Sharpshooters"
 ottoman_panduk_sharpshooter_infantryDESCR:1 "To avoid rebellions, the Turks banned villagers (Reaya) from possessing weapons.  However, as firearms became deadlier, they began to see the need for peasants to be allowed to fight.  They began by hiring Christian huntsmen, then later formed sharpshooter companies out of peasant hunters.  They acted as mounted infantry who could travel quickly and fire at range.  They were among the most effective infantry the Turks had.  These frontiersmen fiercely resisted foreign incursion into their lands with ambushes and joined the main army as skirmishers to repel invaders."
 muslim_two_horned_tofangchi_infantry:1 "Two Horned Tofangchi"
 muslim_two_horned_tofangchi_infantryDESCR:1 "Unlike their European counterparts, Persian musketeers developed heavier guns that had longer ranges.  Weighing about forty pounds each, they needed to rest on two tripods or 'horns' in order to be fired, causing them to be slow but powerful weapons."
 muslim_taifat_al_rusa_infantry:1 "Ta'ifat al Ru'sa Marines"
 muslim_taifat_al_rusa_infantryDESCR:1 "Berber pirates were a constant source of friction, but they also provided a steady source of corsairs who could easily be conscripted and used as marines.  These Ta'ifat al Ru'sa, or Ship Captain Militias, were invaluable in naval warfare and amphibious attacks, replacing regular soldiers such as the Deniz Azaps and Levend of the sixteenth century."
 ottoman_lancer_cavalry:1 "Lancers"
 ottoman_lancer_cavalryDESCR:1 "Just as the infantry had undergone reforms, Turkish cavalry began to adopt European methods and formed lancer corps."
 ottoman_toprakli_dragoon_infantry:1 "Toprakli Dragoons"
 ottoman_toprakli_dragoon_infantryDESCR:1 "With the demise of the Janissaries, there was space to design a new, modern Turkish army.  The Sultan copied ideas from the west to develop a new model army called Nizam-I Cedid.  The prize of this new army were the dragoons, infantry soldiers armed with sabres and carbines who rode on horses to the battlefield, then dismounted in order to fight using western tactics.  This allowed the Turks to make use of their strong cavalry traditions to try and reform the infantry."
 muslim_hunter_cavalry:1 "Hunter Cavalry"
 muslim_hunter_cavalryDESCR:1 "Hunter cavalry were lightly armoured units trained for rapid action.  They specialised in skirmishes and were renowned for their shooting skills.  They proved so useful during the shifting lines of battle that the French army developed these 'Chasseur à Cheval' into a significant part of their cavalry."
 muslim_uhlan_cavalry:1 "Uhlans"
 muslim_uhlan_cavalryDESCR:1 "The first Uhlans were created in the early eighteenth century. They were used primarily for reconnaissance for the more heavily armoured cavalry, as well as being assigned to skirmishes. Later on they became an essential part of the military structure due to their light armour, making them fast and agile on the battlefield, and for their high shock value against their enemies.  Uhlan cavalry were a good alternative to large infantry armies as they were not only heavy hitting but also more cost effective. This allowed smaller nations with less manpower to actually put up an effective fight, as armies on foot were also slower compared to their mounted counterparts."
 muslim_lighthussar_cavalry:1 "Light Hussars"
 muslim_lighthussar_cavalryDESCR:1 "As Cavalry became more specialised, the Hussar started to evolve. The Hussar unit became less like the heavy Polish Hussar and more like the light Hungarian original. The ability of these light and mobile troops to find the enemy, harass them, and overrun their artillery more than made up for their lack of armour."
 muslim_drill_infantry:1 "Drill Infantry"
 muslim_drill_infantryDESCR:1 "Able to fight at close range or from further away, musketeers were versatile indeed - but only if they could react quickly to the shifting battlefield. Frederick of Prussia trained his men rigorously to deal with any situation that could conceivably come up until they became an incredible fighting force that never broke ranks and could fire as much as one shot every fifteen seconds under combat conditions!  This Prussian Drill infantry became the model army for the rest of the world after its stunning successes in battle and was used by both sides in the American Revolution."
 muslim_mass_infantry_tactics:1 "Mass Infantry"
 muslim_mass_infantry_tacticsDESCR:1 "A favourite of the Russians, highly drilled Mass Infantry could be relied on to charge while under fire without breaking, resulting in terrible casualties for the enemy if it succeeded in reaching enemy lines. The bayonet and constant drill brought back the charge tactic in force: mass infantry launched a devastating volley of fire at their enemy, then set their bayonets and charged.  The result could be deadly to their enemies when it succeeded - or deadly to their own side if it failed."
 muslim_rifled_infantry:1 "Rifled Musketeers"
 muslim_rifled_infantryDESCR:1 "Smooth-bore firearms like the musket were notoriously inaccurate, often off by more than a foot at fifty yards.  This meant that musketeers had to fight in tight groups that were vulnerable to increasingly deadly artillery fire. The solution was to introduce rifled muskets that added spin to a bullet and made it fly straight, making these 'rifles' much more accurate and deadly at ranges where a regular musket would be completely ineffective. The downside was that reloading such a gun was time-consuming - a rifle could get off only one shot for every three musket balls - so riflemen were trained to fight in pairs, one shooting while the other reloaded. Although rifles had been put into use by the late eighteenth century, their cost and disadvantages made them relatively rare until much later.  Riflemen such as the Prussian Jaegers, French Voltigeurs or British Greenjackets made excellent sharpshooters and snipers, but because they fought in smaller groups were unable to protect themselves from cavalry.  Most armies maintained small numbers of riflemen in each brigade to compensate for each other's weaknesses."
 muslim_columnar_infantry:1 "Columnar Infantry"
 muslim_columnar_infantryDESCR:1 "Revolutionary France relied on conscript soldiers for the bulk of their army. To give these green troops confidence in battle they placed them in a single column that marched steadily forward toward the enemy to the beat of hundreds of drums. The column presented a thin target that could turn to form a line or dig in to entrenchments that protected them from enemy attack.  The men in front would be killed by enemy fire, but eventually the men would climb over the bodies of their own dead and break through enemy lines.  Although losses could be high, columns often won against other formations through sheer stubbornness and force of numbers."
 muslim_impulse_infantry:1 "Impulse Infantry"
 muslim_impulse_infantryDESCR:1 "Impulse Infantry relied upon a 'cloud' of light infantry that acted as sharpshooters and skirmishers, keeping the enemy pinned down under fire while the main line advanced into position to charge the enemy line and deliver a coup de grace."
 muslim_lancer_cavalry:1 "Lancers"
 muslim_lancer_cavalryDESCR:1 "The creme de la creme of the Napoleonic army. Although their lances made them less agile these cavalry troops were formidable adversaries when charging their enemies directly."
 muslim_breech_infantry:1 "Breech Loaded Riflemen"
 muslim_breech_infantryDESCR:1 "Nearly all early firearms were muzzle-loaded, or loaded from the front. This made even the more advanced guns slow to reload, a critical factor in battle. The first mass-produced breech-loader (back-loaded guns) began appearing in the nineteenth century and made combat much deadlier. Where before a well-trained soldier could fire as many as four shots a minute, even a poorly trained soldier could fire faster with a breech-loaded rifle.  This had the effect of making a single soldier much deadlier than ever before."
 muslim_jominian_infantry:1 "Jominian Infantry"
 muslim_jominian_infantryDESCR:1 "As armies grew in the years following the Napoleonic Wars, so too did the need to properly deploy these armies.  One leading military thinker, Antoine-Henri Jomini, placed heavy emphasis on the concentration of troops with 'interior lines' from which it would be easy to mass power on specific points in the enemy's lines.  In practise, this led to mass charges in order to overwhelm enemy defences.  While this did have the downside of removing emphasis from firepower, many nations were distrustful of a faster rate of fire, fearing troops would expend their ammunition too quickly and flee. These tactics formed the basis of the French, Russian, Austrian, and American military schools well into the nineteenth century."

 asian_mixed_crossbow_infantryDESCR:1 "Mixed infantry who fought in Song Chinese style: the front ranks carried spears and shields, protecting the back ranks of crossbowmen who fired at the enemy.  When available, they also used handheld 'fire arrow' rockets against the enemy.  The Han Chun armies of Yuan China were a good example of this style of warfare."
 asian_warrior_monk_infantry:1 "Warrior Monks"
 asian_warrior_monk_infantryDESCR:1 "Known as Sohei in Japan and Taeguk or Hang-Ma-Gun in Korea, Buddhist monks were a common sight on the battlefield.  Although nominally pacifist, Buddhist monks were known to pursue the art of war, and some monasteries celebrated it by teaching martial arts and intervening in local conflicts.  Monasteries could amass large armies of monks supplemented by peasants who had earned a license as a Buddhist monk in order to avoid taxation.  They were lightly armoured and armed, but many fought with high spirits.  They carried a mix of weaponry, often spears and pole arms."
 asian_tribal_spear_infantry:1 "Tribal Spearmen"
 asian_tribal_spear_infantryDESCR:1 "Warriors who hired their entire tribe as a fighting unit of spearmen.  The Shan were famous for this practise and were very distinctive on the battlefield, led by princes and by women warriors who rode among the troops, inspiring them to fight."
 asian_archer_infantry:1 "Archers"
 asian_archer_infantryDESCR:1 "Lightly armoured irregulars who fought with Tnoo bows, crossbows, or javelin and shield, archers were usually levied troops who fought in little more than a loincloth, with officers wearing plaited bamboo jackets for protection."

 asian_light_foot_infantry:1 "Light Footsoldiers"
 asian_light_foot_infantryDESCR:1 "With the cavalry being the primary weapon of war, infantry were an afterthought for many armies.  Often, they consisted of peasants and criminals who joined feudal armies in return for a share of the loot of the battlefield.  They were undisciplined and ill-equipped but also cheap, and were often used to support heavier troops.  They wore as much armour as they could afford and carried a variety of weapons including swords and spears, making them a mixed force without much cohesion."
 asian_crossbow_elephant_cavalry:1 "Ballista Elephants"
 asian_crossbow_elephant_cavalryDESCR:1 "After being invaded by Cham in the twelfth century, King Jayavarman VII forced the invaders out of Khmer, but adopted Cham elephantry into his army.  Rather than simply carrying spearmen as Khmer elephants had done, Cham troops put Chinese double-row ballistas on elephants, using them as portable missile platforms.  One man guided the elephant, while another two aimed and fired the ballista.  Since enemies kept their distance from the beasts, it allowed the riders to harass the enemy as well as scout the battlefield and signal friendly troops."
 asian_heavy_elephant_cavalry:1 "Heavy Elephants"
 asian_heavy_elephant_cavalryDESCR:1 "Heavy war elephants carried one noble rider as well as a mahout (driver and attendant) in a howdah on the back of the elephant, protected by shields.  They were placed in the centre of the line, able to launch unstoppable charges against enemy infantry, in which they would trample or gore enemy soldiers who did not flee, while their rider would use a trident or spear.  They were useful against cavalry as well, since horses would refuse to get close to the mammoths.  However, when an elephant was in pain or lost its mahout it could go into a frenzy and devastate friendly forces, making it a two-edged sword."
 asian_fire_lance_cavalry:1 "Fire Lancers"
 asian_fire_lance_cavalryDESCR:1 "Heavy cavalry who wore iron plates under fabric and carried a 'pear-flower spear', a type of fire lance that was tipped with a hollow tube filled with gunpowder that could be lit to act as a kind of primitive flamethrower."
 asian_horse_archer_cavalry:1 "Horse Archers"
 asian_horse_archer_cavalryDESCR:1 "With the success of the Mongols in Asia, many countries adopted their style of warfare out of self-defence, or simply hired Mongol mercenaries to act as their cavalry.  These troops acted as horse archers, training in marksmanship.  They used their bows to harass the enemy, staying well outside of their reach with their superior speed."
 asian_singi_cavalry:1 "Sin'gi Cavalry"
 asian_singi_cavalryDESCR:1 "To provide defence against the Mongols, cavalry units known as Sin'gi were placed along the Frontier Districts.  Like the nomads they fought, they were skilled with the bow, but also fought with javelins.  They were heavily armoured and trained by playing polo against each other."
 asian_war_elephant_cavalry:1 "War Elephants"
 asian_war_elephant_cavalryDESCR:1 "Originally the sign of nobility, increasingly war elephants were maintained by the army and ridden by professional soldiers and officers instead of aristocrats.  Their riders wielded javelins, the mahout passing him new ones so he could keep up a steady fire.  The elephants continued to fight as shock cavalry that could trample enemy infantry, and continued to have the same weaknesses as always.  Some limited attempts to armour the elephants failed miserably, and attention was turned to protecting the flanks with an infantry screen instead."
 asian_lancer_bow_cavalry:1 "Bow Lancers"
 asian_lancer_bow_cavalryDESCR:1 "Heavy cavalry who wore a helmet and brigantine armour and carried a sabre, round shield and lance.  They were unable to face spear-armed infantry directly, so waited until the enemy had been softened up before charging into battle."

 asian_elite_horse_cavalryDESCR:1 "Originally the armed retinue of an aristocratic family, after seizing power the Mabyeolcho'o (Elite Horse) was expanded into a regular cavalry corps collected from the best horsemen in the army.  Elite Horse Guards trained in horseback archery by hunting, and fought according to Mongol style but with more use of heavy armour."
 asian_bushi_cavalry:1 "Bushi"
 asian_bushi_cavalryDESCR:1 "A professional caste of soldier who received a fief of land in return for feudal service during war.  The samurai style of combat, called 'the way of horse and bow', was designed to combat the Mongol threat; they wore heavy lamellar o-yoroi armour and fought primarily with bows from horseback, although they could dismount to set up shield walls to launch arrows from.  They also carried a sword if they were forced into melee combat, but this was used as a last resort.  Samurai followed a code of honour known as Bushido similar to European knights."
 asian_phkap_infantry:1 "Phkap Infantry"
 asian_phkap_infantryDESCR:1 "The Phkap was a curved blade mounted on the end of a pole, giving the weapon a longer range than a sword.  It allowed lightly armoured infantry to slash, but required troops to be spread out to have enough space to fight properly."
 asian_fire_lance_infantry:1 "Fire Lance Troops"
 asian_fire_lance_infantryDESCR:1 "Infantry soldiers carrying a variety of weapons, led by officers with fire lances.  Fire lances were tubes filled with black powder attached to the end of a spear, used as a kind of primitive flamethrower.  They were first used by the Chinese, but then used against them by their enemies."
 asian_halberdier_infantry:1 "Halberdiers"
 asian_halberdier_infantryDESCR:1 "Infantry soldiers were granted plots of land in return for both their military support and direct supply of their comrades, with 4 out of 5 men working the land while their fifth comrade served in the army.  Infantry soldiers continued to fight in two ranks: melee in front, ranged behind them.  The front ranks now carried halberd-like pole arms and spears with hooks to unhorse cavalry, while the rear guard held crossbows, fire arrows and, occasionally, large handheld metal tubes that could fire bolts or metal balls at the enemy using gunpowder.  These 'hand guns' were slow to reload and were not especially long ranged, making them not very effective against the Mongol threat, but they could be very effective against infantry in fixed fortifications.  Emperor Yongle was so taken with them that he ordered his troops to open fire with guns before following up with arrows."
 asian_shashu_no_ashigaru_infantry:1 "Mixed Archers"
 asian_shashu_no_ashigaru_infantryDESCR:1 "Inspired by the Mongol hordes who used bows so effectively, some generals began making use of infantry as bowmen, defending them with spearmen.  Although the badly-trained archers were no match for sharpshooter cavalry, they made up for it with sheer numbers.  They were made up of a small core of retainers loyal to their lord supported by casual volunteers enticed by loot during war.  As a result, they lacked discipline and weaponry and armour tended to differ wildly between soldiers."
 asian_fire_arrow_rocket_infantry:1 "Fire Arrow Rocketeers"
 asian_fire_arrow_rocket_infantryDESCR:1 "By the late fourteenth century the secret of manufacturing gunpowder had spread outside China to the Mongols and their vassal states, which also meant that use of fire arrows spread as well.  First used by the Chinese in the tenth century, 'fire arrows' used black powder attached to the body of an arrow inside a handheld cannon, effectively creating a rocket that could fly a hundred metres or more before striking with incredible force, sometimes tipped with pitch in order to start fires as well.  A hit from a fire arrow was deadly, but the weapons were slow to reload and had to be defended from enemy attacks."

However, as enemies became more adept at stopping them, they changed roles from front-line combat to troop carriers and mobile archery towers by constructing wooden towers atop their backs.  Each war elephant could carry as many as a dozen soldiers wielding bows and spears."
 asian_light_cavalry:1 "Light Cavalry"
 asian_light_cavalryDESCR:1 "Seeing the nomads as their primary threat, cavalry became lighter, able to use their speed to catch nomads and force them into battle.  This tactic worked well, as long as the cavalry were numerous enough.  They carried shields to protect them from enemy arrows while approaching, then used halberds, naginata, spears or guan dao swords against the enemy."
 asian_samurai_cavalry:1 "Samurai Heavy Cavalry"
 asian_samurai_cavalryDESCR:1 "As peasant infantry began to pose a greater threat on the battlefield, the samurai warrior caste compensated by replacing their bows with spears, using them to make devastating charges against lines of infantry.  In order to gain more manoeuvrability, they discarded the inflexible o-yoroi armour in favour of more flexible do-maru lamellar favoured by heavy infantry."
 asian_yangban_armored_cavalry:1 "Seoban Cavalry"
 asian_yangban_armored_cavalryDESCR:1 "Following the model used for the civil service, military examinations were implemented to choose officers.  Bureaucrats would be tested in horseback archery, use of lances, and knowledge of military and classical texts.  This class of educated gentry made for excellent soldiers, both because they were able to serve as professional soldiers and also because they could afford the best quality weapons and armour. They fought from horseback wearing heavy armour and were often stationed in the capital or on the frontiers."
 asian_handgunner_infantry:1 "Handgunners"
 asian_handgunner_infantryDESCR:1 "Known as Shenji Ying in Dai Viet, handheld guns began to appear in armies as early as the turn of the fourteenth century.  Originally used by the Chinese, they were improved by the addition of an ironwood wad behind the arrow, which helped propel it to an astounding three hundred yards.  These newer versions were used against the Chinese, then by them.  By the middle of the century, one out of every five or six troops carried a firearm of some kind.  They would open fire at the enemy as one before launching regular attacks."
 asian_repeating_crossbow_infantry:1 "Repeating Crossbowmen"
 asian_repeating_crossbow_infantryDESCR:1 "The Zhuge-Nu was a repeating crossbow invented in the fourth century BC.  It allowed even an untrained soldier to fire quarrels quickly at an enemy, giving them a rate of fire unheard of at the time.  In the hands of a trained crossbowman it could fire as many as ten bolts in fifteen seconds!  However, the repeating crossbow was both inaccurate and weak compared to other missile weapons, and as a result was mainly used in siege warfare where range was not an issue, or for untrained conscripts who would fire them en masse.  Despite its limitations, the repeating crossbow saw use in war until the nineteenth century.  It was introduced to Korea as the Sunogung in the fifteenth century."
 asian_five_commands_infantry:1 "Five Commands Infantry"
 asian_five_commands_infantryDESCR:1 "In an attempt to centralise the army, private armies were forcibly attached to the regular army, which was reorganised into five commands, each given authority over one fifth of the nation.  The core of the army were professional troops selected by tests of archery and swordsmanship, supported by ranks of conscript soldiers who were badly trained and equipped.  At the same time, different kinds of fire arrows were tested to come up with improved rockets."
 asian_samurai_infantry:1 "Samurai Heavy Infantry"
 asian_samurai_infantryDESCR:1 "As the Mongol threat receded, the samurai warrior caste began to change their tactics to better suit internal war.  Cavalry was less useful in mountainous terrain, and street fighting in cities forced cavalry onto foot.  These samurai infantry wore more flexible lamellar do-maru armour and carried naginata pole arms, but increasingly they relied on their swords, which were effective at close quarter combat.  As a result, many schools of fencing emerged in this period."
 asian_chong_and_crossbow_infantry:1 "Chong and Crossbowmen"
 asian_chong_and_crossbow_infantryDESCR:1 "Nations that adopted gunpowder weapons expanded against their neighbours which relied on more traditional weaponry.  However, the secrets of these weapons were jealously kept, and it could be difficult and expensive to procure them.  Even the most advanced nations did not maintain armies purely of 'chong' (handguns), but instead had elite 'chong and crossbow' units which were attached to larger armies."
 asian_rocketeer_infantry:1 "Rocketeers"
 asian_rocketeer_infantryDESCR:1 "In the mid-sixteenth century, firearms became a standard part of infantry forces, mostly fire arrow rockets.  Rocketeers fought side by side with archers, swordsmen and pikemen.  The majority wore little armour, although officers continued to wear heavy lamellar and metal armour."
 asian_yarigumi_infantry:1 "Yarigumi Spearmen"
 asian_yarigumi_infantryDESCR:1 "As it became apparent that a well-trained force of light infantry could overwhelm aristocratic heavy infantry, infantry were treated with greater respect - especially since they could easily slip over the border and be welcomed into a rival's army.  Over time, the Ashigaru evolved from peasant volunteers into a low-ranking military caste that wore heavier armour and was highly trained in the yari spear.  Unlike samurai spearmen, who used their naginata to thrust at the enemy, Ashigaru used their long spears as pike formations, holding them three rows deep to present enemies with a wall of points that was very effective against cavalry."
 asian_armored_elephant_cavalry:1 "Armoured Elephants"
 asian_armored_elephant_cavalryDESCR:1 "As firearms became deadlier on the battlefield, war elephants became targets for the enemy.  In reaction, war elephants wore iron cuirasses to protect them from bullets, although they still needed close-up protection.  This once again placed them in the role of shock troops who could charge at enemy lines to devastating result."
 asian_northern_guard_cavalry:1 "Northern Guard Cavalry"
 asian_northern_guard_cavalryDESCR:1 "Heavy cavalry who wore metal armour and carried tridents, spears, glaives and flails which they used with deadly effect from horseback at close range, and composite bows which they fired from long range."
 asian_late_samurai_cavalry:1 "Calvinist Samurai Cavalry"
 asian_late_samurai_cavalryDESCR:1 "The introduction of muskets spelled the end of the Samurai on the battlefield.  Unable to charge at enemies armed with the weapon, and unable to cause much damage with bows, heavy cavalry changed tactics.  They relied on front ranks of musketeer infantry to soften up the enemy with volleys of fire, then launched a devastating charge followed by hand-to-hand combat with spears and occasionally swords.  They wore lamellar armour with metal breastplates to protect them from firearms."
 asian_chong_infantry:1 "Chong Gunners"
 asian_chong_infantryDESCR:1 "Gunpowder weapons became increasingly common, making up as much as 1 in 3 soldiers in the army.  In addition to the 'chong' handguns, elite soldiers were known to make use of 'fire arrow' rockets and officers used signal guns to give orders during the chaos of the battlefield.  However, guns were still not a common weapon, and troops were ordered to count them before and after battle so as not to lose any to the enemy.  The favoured tactic was to fire all the chong simultaneously, following it up with a conventional attack."
 asian_mandarin_infantry:1 "Mandarin Infantry"
 asian_mandarin_infantryDESCR:1 "Faced with highly disciplined Wokou pirates who could attack anywhere on one hand, and a large but badly trained and equipped army on the other, general Ch'i Chi-kuang developed the 'Mandarin Duck' squad formation to compensate.  Troops were reorganised into 12-man squads, with each man having a precise role: spearmen to ward off enemy swordsmen, swordsmen to protect the flanks, troops carrying bamboo saplings to entangle the enemy, troops carrying fire lances to guard the rear, and an officer and porter to round out the unit.  The result was a defensive unit that required little training or equipment and could fight independently on the battlefield."
 asian_fire_cart_infantry:1 "Fire Cart Infantry"
 asian_fire_cart_infantryDESCR:1 "Fire arrow rockets were effective weapons, but had a slow reload time that limited the actions of infantry.  As a way to overcome this limitation, the rockets were loaded aboard mobile carts, then fired simultaneously at enemy lines with devastating effect.  This allowed the infantry to carry swords and pole arms, able to charge at the enemy or defend the carts from them while they were reloading.  As a result, rockets regained power on the battlefield.  They were most famously used by the Koreans during the Imjin war, where they were called Hwacha."
 asian_arquebusier_infantry:1 "Harquebusiers"
 asian_arquebusier_infantryDESCR:1 "Compared to bows, European-inspired matchlock muskets required very little training and had very long ranges.  This made them ideal weapons to give to lower class footsoldiers, despite their many disadvantages.  In battle, Arquebusiers stood in lines and used volley tactics to ensure a steady rate of fire against enemy lines.  In between every two arquebusiers, an archer served as a sharpshooter and a spearman wearing lacquered or metal armour screened enemy troops.  If an enemy got too close, the arquebusiers would drop their guns and pull out swords instead.  The Japanese used them to great effectiveness in the battle of Nagashino, when 'Teppo Ashigaru' stopped cavalry charges cold."
 asian_hundred_son_infantry:1 "Hundred Son Infantry"
 asian_hundred_son_infantryDESCR:1 "With both sides increasingly making use of chong handguns, armies turned to bigger guns to gain the advantage.  Infantry made use of 'big chong' cannons (dachong baizi huoqi) and hundred-son (100-bullet) guns capable of firing dozens of bullets at the enemy in one explosion.  Although these large weapons were cumbersome and not very accurate, they were efficient at crushing revolts and besieging fortresses."
 asian_wagon_infantry:1 "Wagon Infantry"
 asian_wagon_infantryDESCR:1 "Nomad horsemen were difficult to fight with slow-moving infantry, and could attack at any time.  One novel tactic to overcome this problem was to group infantry into small units, each centred around a wagon.  Twenty men would march, while a two-wheeled war wagon would carry two light artillery pieces and a team of ten men to operate them.  Four of this team would also carry European-style matchlock muskets that could strike at a distance.  This system allowed the army to bring the advantage of gunpowder with them wherever they went."
 asian_samsubyong_infantry:1 "Three Combat Forces"
 asian_samsubyong_infantryDESCR:1 "Long experience fighting the Wokou pirates led to the development of new tactics and weapons, culminating in the publishing of the manual 'New Book of Practical Tactics'.  Armies based on this new way of fighting were called the Three Combat Forces (Samsubyong), since they were divided into three corps: archers, swordsmen, and musketeers using sungja, or 'victory guns'.  At the same time, the feudal system of requiring peasants to serve in the army was being replaced with feudal taxation that paid for a professional class of soldiers.  Together, the new army represented a dynamic new force capable of dealing with any kind of opponent."
 asian_banner_infantry:1 "Banner Infantry"
 asian_banner_infantryDESCR:1 "The Eight Banner system reorganised the entire population into military units and supporting households, disrupting the old tribal hierarchies that had previously dominated.  The new army was not only larger, but also more loyal to the central government."
 asian_musketeer_infantry:1 "Musketeers"
 asian_musketeer_infantryDESCR:1 "Matchlock muskets were inaccurate and slow weapons, but they had excellent range.  With well-trained soldiers and extra muskets, a troop of musketeers could stop a cavalry charge, as they proved at the battle of Nagashino.  At the same time, armies found various ways to compensate for the biggest weakness of matchlock muskets - the need to keep the matches dry.  Matches began to be chemically treated to be weatherproof, and some muskets had protective boxes to keep water out.  From an initial ratio of two guns to one pole arm, by the end of the sixteenth century Musketeers had adopted a ratio of four to one, relying mainly on their swords if an enemy reached their lines."
 asian_war_elephant_artillery_cavalry:1 "Artillery Elephants"
 asian_war_elephant_artillery_cavalryDESCR:1 "With the arrival of firearms, specialised elephant corps were formed armed with swivel guns on their backs, attended by two soldiers, in addition to the usual driver and musketeer.  Elephants continued to be screened by infantry to protect them, although they were rarely hurt by musket balls."
 asian_horse_guard_cavalry:1 "Horse Guard"
 asian_horse_guard_cavalryDESCR:1 "Samurai cavalry were well-trained and heavily armoured, but were also sometimes difficult to control due to their pride and personal codes of honour.  In the sixteenth century, they began to be replaced with professional troops known as Horse Guards.  Heavily armed and armoured, they were made up of lower-class troops loyal to their commander.  At first they played the role of elite bodyguards, but as time went on, began to make up large parts of the cavalry, until finally they supplanted them entirely."
 asian_dragoon_cavalry:1 "Dragoons"
 asian_dragoon_cavalryDESCR:1 "Nomad horsemen were difficult to fight, able to pick the time and place of battles and more numerous than regular cavalry forces.  In order to deal with this threat, the role of cavalry changed into dragoons - mounted infantry who could reach the battlefield quickly, but then fight on foot.  This placed the infantry in the role of stopping cavalry charges, while the cavalry made sure the infantry held."
 asian_forbidden_soldier_cavalry:1 "Forbidden Soldiers"
 asian_forbidden_soldier_cavalryDESCR:1 "Attempts to divide the country into military districts under the authority of different armies worked well in peacetime, but badly when threatened with invasion.  This system was replaced with a permanent, salaried force of cavalry based in the capital.  Each unit would be filled with peasants from villages near the capital in order to foster a sense of cohesion, and to avoid the corrupting influence of the city."
 asian_new_guard_infantry:1 "New Guard"
 asian_new_guard_infantryDESCR:1 "Infantry tended to wear whatever armour they could afford, or more often, whatever their lord could afford.  Because of this, feudal infantry wore a wide variety of armour.  A national army paid for by a central government was different: it consisted of low-class guardsmen who owed their loyalty to the state, and who had standardised arms, armour and uniforms provided."
 asian_matchlock_musketeer_infantry:1 "Matchlock Musketeers"
 asian_matchlock_musketeer_infantryDESCR:1 "Trade with European nations brought their muskets to the attention of Asia - sometimes against them on the battlefield.  Using captured muskets or European adventurers, armies began experimenting with European-style weapons and liked what they saw.  Casting aside Chinese handguns in favour of the more accurate muskets, entire regiments of musketeers were trained.  These musketeers relied on swords for self-defence rather than screens of spearmen.  Although they often used European weaponry to begin with, it was not long before domestic imitations were produced, and then improved on.  At the same time, they continued to supplement firearms with rockets."
 asian_charge_infantry:1 "Charge Infantry"
 asian_charge_infantryDESCR:1 "With large armies of unreliable troops, the solution was obvious: officers and their bodyguards, all chosen for their fighting ability, led the army from the front lines.  These men swore oaths to die before fleeing, and their desperate charges not only threw enemies into disarray, they also inspired less reliable troops to stand and fight.  Although these charge tactics helped win victories, they also prevented generals from employing more subtle tactics and manoeuvres."
 asian_green_standard_infantry:1 "Green Standard Infantry"
 asian_green_standard_infantryDESCR:1 "Enemy troops often came from low social status and were paid so badly they could not afford families.  Attracted by the promise of regular pay, many took the opportunity to switch sides and sign up for long enlistments.  Bringing with them mastery of gunpowder weapons, they were eagerly embraced as an army within the army - the Green Standard Army."
 asian_volley_infantry:1 "Volley Fire Musketeers"
 asian_volley_infantryDESCR:1 "During the thirty years war, Sweden's king Gustavus Adolphus revolutionized warfare by training his musketeers vigorously in a new tactic. Instead of using countermarch tactics, the troops were trained to stand in three lines so that at any time one line was kneeling, one line was crouching, and one line was firing at the enemy. This demanded an incredible level of discipline and training to accomplish, making Swedish troops some of the most professional in the world. In addition, regiments were reduced from 3,000 men to a mere 500, making them more manoeuvrable on the battlefield."
 asian_platoon_infantry:1 "Platoon Fire Musketeers"
 asian_platoon_infantryDESCR:1 "Bayonets were introduced in the mid-seventeenth century and were gradually refined and made more reliable.  Throughout the seventeenth century tactics remained the same: musketeers advanced slowly on the enemy, pausing to fire volleys at them in an attempt to break the enemy line, allowing cavalry to pursue and mop up the scattered enemy.  When this failed, a bayonet charge and hand-to-hand combat was necessary.  This tactic gradually made pikemen superfluous on the battlefield, and where there had been three pikemen to every musketeer by the beginning of the century, there were five musketeers to every pikemen by its end.  Scottish Highlanders were known for being willing to charge the enemy just as much as shoot at them."

This tactic gradually made pikemen superfluous on the battlefield, and where there had been three pikemen to every musketeer by the beginning of the century, there were five musketeers to every pikemen by its end.  British Redcoats used their bayonets to keep the enemy at bay while picking them off with musket fire."
 asian_carabinier_cavalry:1 "Carabiniers"
 asian_carabinier_cavalryDESCR:1 "The Carabiniers first came into being in the late sixteenth century and were a type of heavy cavalry that had many things in common with Cuirassiers. They also wore protective armour, though slightly less than a Cuirassier. The main difference between the two cavalry forces was their armament. A Carabinier's main weapon was the carbine, a short wheellock handgun. In addition to the carbine, they were also armed with a sword."
 asian_armeblanche_cavalry:1 "Arme Blanche Cavalry"
 asian_armeblanche_cavalryDESCR:1 "While the hussar Cavalry represented the balance between fire and shock and the Dragoon cavalry relied primarily on their muskets, Arme Blanche cavalry relied primarily on cold steel. The bold charges of these units could shatter enemy formations."
 asian_mediumhussar_cavalry:1 "Medium Hussars"
 asian_mediumhussar_cavalryDESCR:1 "Armoured Knights remained the predominant form of cavalry in Western Europe long after other parts of the world had moved toward more mobile light cavalry.  At the battle of Adrianople, the cream of Western European nobility met the Ottoman light cavalry and was soundly defeated by their superior mobility.  In comparison, the Hungarians and Poles used lighter cavalry called Hussars that had more success.  Forced to confront this new reality, Western European armies began to adopt Polish Winged Hussar cavalry in place of the aristocratic knights."
 asian_bayonet_infantry:1 "Bayonet Infantry"
 asian_bayonet_infantryDESCR:1 "The use of volley tactics, the introduction of safer, more reliable flintlock muskets and the use of bayonets in close combat eliminated the need for pikemen on the battlefield by the turn of the eighteenth century, and soon new tactics were developed to suit.  Now that musketeers had reliable bayonets, infantry charges were once again a viable strategy in battle, allowing them to once again claim the initiative on the battlefield."
 asian_line_infantry:1 "Line Infantry"
 asian_line_infantryDESCR:1 "The use of volley tactics, the introduction of safer, more reliable flintlock muskets and the use of bayonets in close combat eliminated the need for pikemen on the battlefield by the turn of the eighteenth century.  Soon afterwards, new tactics were developed to suit this reality.  The most popular and arguably most effective tactic was to form a thin line facing the enemy so that musketeers could inflict maximum casualties on the enemy and react quickly to enemy movement. This also allowed for specialised soldiers to appear along the line such as the grenadier."
 asian_skirmisher_infantry:1 "Irregular Skirmishers"
 asian_skirmisher_infantryDESCR:1 "Standing armies were small, and even in the seventeenth century levies were called upon during wartime to make up the bulk of the army. These conscript troops did not have the training or discipline of regulars and were often distrusted by their commanders. With more accurate and faster guns making pike screens unnecessary, some commanders began using these men as irregular infantry who operated as marksmen and skirmishers in small units around the main army. These irregular skirmishers could help scout unfamiliar terrain, pin down enemy units until the main force could arrive, and best of all, were expendable. Austria in particular made great use of their 'Grenzers', who made up over a quarter of the Austrian army."
 asian_hunter_cavalry:1 "Hunter Cavalry"
 asian_hunter_cavalryDESCR:1 "Hunter cavalry were lightly armoured units trained for rapid action.  They specialised in skirmishes and were renowned for their shooting skills.  They proved so useful during the shifting lines of battle that the French army developed these 'Chasseur à Cheval' into a significant part of their cavalry."
 asian_uhlan_cavalry:1 "Uhlans"
 asian_uhlan_cavalryDESCR:1 "The first Uhlans were created in the early eighteenth century. They were used primarily for reconnaissance for the more heavily armoured cavalry, as well as being assigned to skirmishes. Later on they became an essential part of the military structure due to their light armour, making them fast and agile on the battlefield, and for their high shock value against their enemies.  Uhlan cavalry were a good alternative to large infantry armies as they were not only heavy hitting but also more cost effective. This allowed smaller nations with less manpower to actually put up an effective fight, as armies on foot were also slower compared to their mounted counterparts."
 asian_lighthussar_cavalry:1 "Light Hussars"
 asian_lighthussar_cavalryDESCR:1 "As Cavalry became more specialised, the Hussar started to evolve. The Hussar unit became less like the heavy Polish Hussar and more like the light Hungarian original. The ability of these light and mobile troops to find the enemy, harass them, and overrun their artillery more than made up for their lack of armour."
 asian_drill_infantry:1 "Drill Infantry"
 asian_drill_infantryDESCR:1 "Able to fight at close range or from further away, musketeers were versatile indeed - but only if they could react quickly to the shifting battlefield. Frederick of Prussia trained his men rigorously to deal with any situation that could conceivably come up until they became an incredible fighting force that never broke ranks and could fire as much as one shot every fifteen seconds under combat conditions!  This Prussian Drill infantry became the model army for the rest of the world after its stunning successes in battle and was used by both sides in the American Revolution."
 asian_mass_infantry:1 "Mass Infantry"
 asian_mass_infantryDESCR:1 "A favourite of the Russians, highly drilled Mass Infantry could be relied on to charge while under fire without breaking, resulting in terrible casualties for the enemy if it succeeded in reaching enemy lines. The bayonet and constant drill brought back the charge tactic in force: mass infantry launched a devastating volley of fire at their enemy, then set their bayonets and charged.  The result could be deadly to their enemies when it succeeded - or deadly to their own side if it failed."
 asian_rifled_infantry:1 "Rifled Musketeers"
 asian_rifled_infantryDESCR:1 "Smooth-bore firearms like the musket were notoriously inaccurate, often off by more than a foot at fifty yards.  This meant that musketeers had to fight in tight groups that were vulnerable to increasingly deadly artillery fire. The solution was to introduce rifled muskets that added spin to a bullet and made it fly straight, making these 'rifles' much more accurate and deadly at ranges where a regular musket would be completely ineffective. The downside was that reloading such a gun was time-consuming - a rifle could get off only one shot for every three musket balls - so riflemen were trained to fight in pairs, one shooting while the other reloaded. Although rifles had been put into use by the late eighteenth century, their cost and disadvantages made them relatively rare until much later.  Riflemen such as the Prussian Jaegers, French Voltigeurs or British Greenjackets made excellent sharpshooters and snipers, but because they fought in smaller groups were unable to protect themselves from cavalry.  Most armies maintained small numbers of riflemen in each brigade to compensate for each other's weaknesses."
 asian_columnar_infantry:1 "Columnar Infantry"
 asian_columnar_infantryDESCR:1 "Revolutionary France relied on conscript soldiers for the bulk of their army. To give these green troops confidence in battle they placed them in a single column that marched steadily forward toward the enemy to the beat of hundreds of drums. The column presented a thin target that could turn to form a line or dig in to entrenchments that protected them from enemy attack.  The men in front would be killed by enemy fire, but eventually the men would climb over the bodies of their own dead and break through enemy lines.  Although losses could be high, columns often won against other formations through sheer stubbornness and force of numbers."
 asian_impulse_infantry:1 "Impulse Infantry"
 asian_impulse_infantryDESCR:1 "Impulse Infantry relied upon a 'cloud' of light infantry that acted as sharpshooters and skirmishers, keeping the enemy pinned down under fire while the main line advanced into position to charge the enemy line and deliver a coup de grace."
 asian_lancer_cavalry:1 "Lancers"
 asian_lancer_cavalryDESCR:1 "The creme de la creme of the Napoleonic army. Although their lances made them less agile these cavalry troops were formidable adversaries when charging their enemies directly."
 asian_breech_infantry:1 "Breech Loaded Riflemen"
 asian_breech_infantryDESCR:1 "Nearly all early firearms were muzzle-loaded, or loaded from the front. This made even the more advanced guns slow to reload, a critical factor in battle. The first mass-produced breech-loader (back-loaded guns) began appearing in the nineteenth century and made combat much deadlier. Where before a well-trained soldier could fire as many as four shots a minute, even a poorly trained soldier could fire faster with a breech-loaded rifle.  This had the effect of making a single soldier much deadlier than ever before."
 asian_jominian_infantry:1 "Jominian Infantry"
 asian_jominian_infantryDESCR:1 "As armies grew in the years following the Napoleonic Wars, so too did the need to properly deploy these armies.  One leading military thinker, Antoine-Henri Jomini, placed heavy emphasis on the concentration of troops with 'interior lines' from which it would be easy to mass power on specific points in the enemy's lines.  In practise, this led to mass charges in order to overwhelm enemy defences.  While this did have the downside of removing emphasis from firepower, many nations were distrustful of a faster rate of fire, fearing troops would expend their ammunition too quickly and flee. These tactics formed the basis of the French, Russian, Austrian, and American military schools well into the nineteenth century."
 steppes_swarm_cavalry:1 "Swarm Cavalry"
 steppes_swarm_cavalryDESCR:1 "Under the system perfected by Ghengis Khan, every man between the ages of 15 and 60 served in the army in return for a share of the loot.  Formed into decimal units of horsemen, the armies were highly flexible.  Most fought as light cavalry or horse archers, specializing in a feigned retreat ('mangudai') that could go on for days until heavy cavalry could ambush and encircle the enemy in a swarm.  Most wore heavy coats and silk shirts that could stop arrows and carried swords, daggers and composite bows made from yak horns.  In the south, these horse archers were known as Tirkash-band."
 steppes_spear_infantry:1 "Spear Infantry"
 steppes_spear_infantryDESCR:1 "After their initial conquests, the Mongols began accepting surrendered enemies into their armies as auxiliaries and besiegers, especially those with knowledge of siege machinery or gunpowder.  These troops fought with a variety of weapons including spears, axes and crossbows.  When available, they also used handheld 'fire arrow' rockets against the enemy.  Most fought for a share of the loot, or in return for fiefs, rather than for pay.  The Han Chun armies of Yuan China were a good example of this style of warfare."
 steppes_sarbardar_militia_infantry:1 "Sarbardar Militia"
 steppes_sarbardar_militia_infantryDESCR:1 "By the fourteenth century, Mongol soldiers were paid a modest salary in exchange for their service.  This allowed them to maintain urban militia forces which provided defence against invaders and were invaluable during the sieges of enemy cities.  They wore light armour but carried spears, crossbows and rockets which they used in battle.  Timur made good use of them during his conquest of Transoxiana."
 steppes_archer_infantry:1 "Archers"
 steppes_archer_infantryDESCR:1 "Influenced by the Muslim warriors they encountered, Tatar footsoldiers wore mail hauberks and carried shields and sabres, but their weapon of choice continued to be their traditional compound bows.  At the same time, they eagerly adopted gunpowder weapons.  Some soldiers carried metal pipes that sealed at one end and lit them to fire shot or arrows at the enemy."
 steppes_heavy_swarm_cavalry:1 "Heavy Swarm Cavalry"
 steppes_heavy_swarm_cavalryDESCR:1 "The core of the army was ethnic tribes who agreed to send men to fight in return for tax-exempt status for the tribe and fiefs (suyurghal) for the men.  What made them better than earlier armies was the brutal discipline imposed on the men and the increasing share of the army devoted to heavy cavalry.  The discipline allowed commanders to order rapid changes and frequent attacks on the enemy, and the heavier armour made charges more effective.  To take advantage of these two advantages, the army was divided into eight or more autonomous parts, rather than the traditional three."
 steppes_divani_swarm_cavalry:1 "Divani Swarm Cavalry"
 steppes_divani_swarm_cavalryDESCR:1 "The weapons and tactics of Mongol armies remained static for centuries.  However, the organisation of their armies changed radically.  Rather than being commanded by tribal leaders, the army was led by a general staff (tuvaji divani) which maintained strict discipline among the men."
 steppes_heavy_infantry:1 "Heavy Infantry"
 steppes_heavy_infantryDESCR:1 "Reflecting Muslim influence, fifteenth century Tatar infantry wore heavy mail-and-plate armour and carried sabres as their weapon of choice.  They also carried bows and crossbows, as well as the occasional gunpowder rocket."
 steppes_tumandar_cavalry:1 "Tumandar Cavalry"
 steppes_tumandar_cavalryDESCR:1 "With increasingly sophisticated economies came better access to metal armour. By the end of the fifteenth century, Mongol cavalry wore high quality armour including helmets, cuirasses, plated vambraces and mail and plate.  Their primary weapons were the same sabres and bows of their ancestors, although they also carried spears and maces.  This allowed them not only to harass the enemy, but also protect the flanks.  Despite this, Mongol cavalry continued to prefer to fight from long range, launching a massed volley of arrows against enemy formations with devastating effect."
 steppes_handgunner_infantry:1 "Hand-Gunners"
 steppes_handgunner_infantryDESCR:1 "Tatar troops carried sabres for hand-to-hand combat, but increasingly relied upon gunpowder harquebus weapons in combat.  In urban warfare, they took advantage of wooden palisades to find cover and made use of a large hook-gun ('zatinnaya pishal') to fire six-foot-long iron arrows at enemies under cover."
 steppes_yikitlar_cavalry:1 "Yikitlar Braves"
 steppes_yikitlar_cavalryDESCR:1 "Sixteenth century Mongols wore lamellar cuirasses and carried shields and sabres, but fought with both bows and matchlock muskets.  In addition to the feigned retreats and swarm tactics the Mongols were famous for, Yikitlar 'braves' used the novel tactic of attacking while cavalry wings supported them.  They were famously used by Babur in his conquest of Delhi."
 steppes_banner_infantry:1 "Bannermen"
 steppes_banner_infantryDESCR:1 "The Banner system reorganised the entire population into military units and supporting households, disrupting the old tribal hierarchies that had previously dominated.  The new army was not only larger, but also more loyal to the central government.  The Banners also allowed different ethnic groups to serve in separate units.  The Manchu Eight Banner Army proved its effectiveness when they conquered China."

 steppes_firelock_cavalryDESCR:1 "By the late sixteenth century, the Mongols had replaced their bows with carbines.  They maintained their distance from the enemy, preferring to avoid charges and hand-to-hand combat in favour of firing pistols at range and skirmishing."
 steppes_raid_cavalry:1 "Raid Cavalry"
 steppes_raid_cavalryDESCR:1 "Faced with artillery and muskets, Mongol armies found it difficult to maintain the cohesion and momentum required for their traditional tactics.  Instead, they hung back from open battle, harassing the enemy from a distance and preventing them from concentrating their fire.  While the enemy force was distracted by this, small units would break off from the Mongol army to raid deep into the now-unprotected enemy territory, or Mongol rulers would negotiate the defection of key enemy units."
 steppes_green_standard_infantry:1 "Green Standard Infantry"
 steppes_green_standard_infantryDESCR:1 "Enemy troops often came from low social status and were paid so badly they could not afford families.  Attracted by the promise of regular pay, many took the opportunity to switch sides and sign up for long enlistments.  Bringing with them mastery of gunpowder weapons, they were eagerly embraced as an army within the army - the Green Standard Army."
 steppes_shock_cavalry:1 "Shock Cavalry"
 steppes_shock_cavalryDESCR:1 "Tatar horsemen adopted a long lance, transforming into shock troops who could launch a devastating charge against enemy lines before switching to a sabre to finish off the enemy.  This model was so successful that it was widely copied by their enemies.  It was used by the Kalmyks at the Battle of Poltava to devastating effect."
 steppes_field_army_infantry:1 "Metropolitan Field Army"
 steppes_field_army_infantryDESCR:1 "Recognising how outdated their tactics and weaponry had become, government officials attempted to modernise the army by creating an elite 'field force' to defend the capital.  Made up of elite troops from across the nation, the Metropolitan Field Force acquired advanced western rifles and cannons and was drilled by foreign officers.  The Peking Field Force of the Qing Empire was 40,000 troops strong."
 steppes_carabinier_cavalry:1 "Carabiniers"
 steppes_carabinier_cavalryDESCR:1 "The Carabiniers first came into being in the late sixteenth century and were a type of heavy cavalry that had many things in common with Cuirassiers. They also wore protective armour, though slightly less than a Cuirassier. The main difference between the two cavalry forces was their armament. A Carabinier's main weapon was the carbine, a short wheellock handgun. In addition to the carbine, they were also armed with a sword."
 steppes_armeblanche_cavalry:1 "Arme Blanche Cavalry"
 steppes_armeblanche_cavalryDESCR:1 "While the hussar Cavalry represented the balance between fire and shock and the Dragoon cavalry relied primarily on their muskets, Arme Blanche cavalry relied primarily on cold steel. The bold charges of these units could shatter enemy formations."
 steppes_mediumhussar_cavalry:1 "Medium Hussars"
 steppes_mediumhussar_cavalryDESCR:1 "Armoured Knights remained the predominant form of cavalry in Western Europe long after other parts of the world had moved toward more mobile light cavalry.  At the battle of Adrianople, the cream of Western European nobility met the Ottoman light cavalry and was soundly defeated by their superior mobility.  In comparison, the Hungarians and Poles used lighter cavalry called Hussars that had more success.  Forced to confront this new reality, Western European armies began to adopt Polish Winged Hussar cavalry in place of the aristocratic knights."
 steppes_hunter_cavalry:1 "Hunter Cavalry"
 steppes_hunter_cavalryDESCR:1 "Hunter cavalry were lightly armoured units trained for rapid action.  They specialised in skirmishes and were renowned for their shooting skills.  They proved so useful during the shifting lines of battle that the French army developed these 'Chasseur à Cheval' into a significant part of their cavalry."
 steppes_uhlan_cavalry:1 "Uhlans"
 steppes_uhlan_cavalryDESCR:1 "The first Uhlans were created in the early eighteenth century. They were used primarily for reconnaissance for the more heavily armoured cavalry, as well as being assigned to skirmishes. Later on they became an essential part of the military structure due to their light armour, making them fast and agile on the battlefield, and for their high shock value against their enemies.  Uhlan cavalry were a good alternative to large infantry armies as they were not only heavy hitting but also more cost effective. This allowed smaller nations with less manpower to actually put up an effective fight, as armies on foot were also slower compared to their mounted counterparts."
 steppes_lighthussar_cavalry:1 "Light Hussars"
 steppes_lighthussar_cavalryDESCR:1 "As Cavalry became more specialised, the Hussar started to evolve. The Hussar unit became less like the heavy Polish Hussar and more like the light Hungarian original. The ability of these light and mobile troops to find the enemy, harass them, and overrun their artillery more than made up for their lack of armour."
 steppes_drill_infantry:1 "Drill Infantry"
 steppes_drill_infantryDESCR:1 "Able to fight at close range or from further away, musketeers were versatile indeed - but only if they could react quickly to the shifting battlefield. Frederick of Prussia trained his men rigorously to deal with any situation that could conceivably come up until they became an incredible fighting force that never broke ranks and could fire as much as one shot every fifteen seconds under combat conditions!  This Prussian Drill infantry became the model army for the rest of the world after its stunning successes in battle and was used by both sides in the American Revolution."
 steppes_mass_infantry:1 "Mass Infantry"
 steppes_mass_infantryDESCR:1 "A favourite of the Russians, highly drilled Mass Infantry could be relied on to charge while under fire without breaking, resulting in terrible casualties for the enemy if it succeeded in reaching enemy lines. The bayonet and constant drill brought back the charge tactic in force: mass infantry launched a devastating volley of fire at their enemy, then set their bayonets and charged.  The result could be deadly to their enemies when it succeeded - or deadly to their own side if it failed."
 steppes_rifled_infantry:1 "Rifled Musketeers"
 steppes_rifled_infantryDESCR:1 "Smooth-bore firearms like the musket were notoriously inaccurate, often off by more than a foot at fifty yards.  This meant that musketeers had to fight in tight groups that were vulnerable to increasingly deadly artillery fire. The solution was to introduce rifled muskets that added spin to a bullet and made it fly straight, making these 'rifles' much more accurate and deadly at ranges where a regular musket would be completely ineffective. The downside was that reloading such a gun was time-consuming - a rifle could get off only one shot for every three musket balls - so riflemen were trained to fight in pairs, one shooting while the other reloaded. Although rifles had been put into use by the late eighteenth century, their cost and disadvantages made them relatively rare until much later.  Riflemen such as the Prussian Jaegers, French Voltigeurs or British Greenjackets made excellent sharpshooters and snipers, but because they fought in smaller groups were unable to protect themselves from cavalry.  Most armies maintained small numbers of riflemen in each brigade to compensate for each other's weaknesses."
 steppes_columnar_infantry:1 "Columnar Infantry"
 steppes_columnar_infantryDESCR:1 "Revolutionary France relied on conscript soldiers for the bulk of their army. To give these green troops confidence in battle they placed them in a single column that marched steadily forward toward the enemy to the beat of hundreds of drums. The column presented a thin target that could turn to form a line or dig in to entrenchments that protected them from enemy attack.  The men in front would be killed by enemy fire, but eventually the men would climb over the bodies of their own dead and break through enemy lines.  Although losses could be high, columns often won against other formations through sheer stubbornness and force of numbers."
 steppes_impulse_infantry:1 "Impulse Infantry"
 steppes_impulse_infantryDESCR:1 "Impulse Infantry relied upon a 'cloud' of light infantry that acted as sharpshooters and skirmishers, keeping the enemy pinned down under fire while the main line advanced into position to charge the enemy line and deliver a coup de grace."
 steppes_lancer_cavalry:1 "Lancers"
 steppes_lancer_cavalryDESCR:1 "The creme de la creme of the Napoleonic army. Although their lances made them less agile these cavalry troops were formidable adversaries when charging their enemies directly."
 steppes_breech_infantry:1 "Breech Loaded Riflemen"
 steppes_breech_infantryDESCR:1 "Nearly all early firearms were muzzle-loaded, or loaded from the front. This made even the more advanced guns slow to reload, a critical factor in battle. The first mass-produced breech-loader (back-loaded guns) began appearing in the nineteenth century and made combat much deadlier. Where before a well-trained soldier could fire as many as four shots a minute, even a poorly trained soldier could fire faster with a breech-loaded rifle.  This had the effect of making a single soldier much deadlier than ever before."
 steppes_jominian_infantry:1 "Jominian Infantry"
 steppes_jominian_infantryDESCR:1 "As armies grew in the years following the Napoleonic Wars, so too did the need to properly deploy these armies.  One leading military thinker, Antoine-Henri Jomini, placed heavy emphasis on the concentration of troops with 'interior lines' from which it would be easy to mass power on specific points in the enemy's lines.  In practise, this led to mass charges in order to overwhelm enemy defences.  While this did have the downside of removing emphasis from firepower, many nations were distrustful of a faster rate of fire, fearing troops would expend their ammunition too quickly and flee. These tactics formed the basis of the French, Russian, Austrian, and American military schools well into the nineteenth century."
 north_american_woodlands_warrior_infantry:1 "Woodlands Warriors"
 north_american_woodlands_warrior_infantryDESCR:1 "Warriors of the Eastern Woodlands were hunters who were most comfortable using bows and flint arrows.  During times of war, they carried wooden or leather shields and sometimes breastplates made of wooden strips laced together, and carried carved wood war clubs.  They tended to fight as individuals, competing for honour in battle.  They were known to make use of the terrain to launch surprise attacks and raids against the enemy.  The Iroquois expressly forbade fighting in the winter in order to avoid giving away their movement through the leafless trees.  In the Southwest, war captains carried sacred bundles made up of animal parts or sacred stones which could never touch ground - doing so meant the war band had to return home in shame."
 north_american_plains_warrior_infantry:1 "Plains Warriors"
 north_american_plains_warrior_infantryDESCR:1 "Hunters first, warriors second, the warriors of the Great Plains preferred to use bows and bone or flint arrows in battle, switching to stone clubs and axes for close combat if needed.  For protection, they carried large shields made from buffalo hide. Each man belonged to one of several warrior societies within his tribe, each competing with the others for honour on the battlefield, such as being the first to touch an opponent in combat.  This meant that they largely fought as individuals.  They wore their finest clothing in battle so as to die properly, but since the warriors represented so many of their tribe, they were famously willing to break off if they lost a large number of lives, even if they were winning."
 north_american_raid_infantry:1 "Raiders"
 north_american_raid_infantryDESCR:1 "As disease sent populations plummeting, many tribes began raiding neighbours to seize prisoners who would be adopted into their own tribe.  These raids required speed and coordination.  War leaders used coloured banners and bone whistles to give commands to their units, a practise which proved to be of even greater use in larger battles."
 north_american_tomahawk_infantry:1 "Tomahawk Warriors"
 north_american_tomahawk_infantryDESCR:1 "As tribes came into contact with foreigners they began trading with them.  Over time, these tribes began trading the goods with tribes further west, and eventually metal goods spread across North America.  Some braves now had access to metal weaponry such as spears, knives and the famous tomahawk.  In the lands closest to the foreigners a few warriors carried flintlock muskets into battle, but mostly as novelties.  In battle they preferred the bow, upgraded with iron and steel arrowheads.  It could fire faster, farther, more accurately and more quietly than the guns they faced, especially in the hands of untrained militias."
 north_american_rider_cavalry:1 "Horse Riders"
 north_american_rider_cavalryDESCR:1 "Only a few generations after foreigners introduced horses to the New World, tribes nearby began capturing them in raids.  At first these horses were relatively few and their riders inexperienced, but this situation would not last long.  The potential they represented was too great to ignore."
 north_american_reformed_tomahawk_infantry:1 "Calvinist Tomahawk Warriors"
 north_american_reformed_tomahawk_infantryDESCR:1 "The effect of steel took some time to ripple through native society.  As it did, warriors stopped wearing armour and carrying hide shields into battle.  This made war deadlier, and increasingly wars were fought not merely to displace or embarrass an enemy, but to completely eradicate him and claim his lands and trade routes as your own."
 north_american_scout_cavalry:1 "Scouts"
 north_american_scout_cavalryDESCR:1 "Within a generation, the horse had transformed Plains society.  Entire tribes changed their way of life, becoming hunters who could follow herds of buffalo across the Great Plains.  This inevitably brought them into conflict with other tribes, giving them many opportunities to practise warfare.  They quickly learned to build smaller shields and bows and longer clubs and axes that could be wielded comfortably from horseback."
 north_american_tradegun_infantry:1 "Trade Gunners"
 north_american_tradegun_infantryDESCR:1 "As foreign settlements grew, many were happy to provide guns and powder to the natives in return for raiding their enemies and providing protection.  Referred to colloquially as 'Indian Trade Guns', they included a wide variety of light, single-shot smooth bore muskets and pistols.  Not only did this give the foreigners valuable allies, it also gave them future trade, as the natives needed to provide valuable furs and other goods in return for new flints, powder or replacement guns.  Although the tribes of the Eastern Woodlands eagerly traded for guns, they did not make much use of them in war.  Warriors complained that the guns were unreliable, had poor accuracy at long range, and spooked prey."
 north_american_dog_soldier_infantry:1 "Dog Soldiers"
 north_american_dog_soldier_infantryDESCR:1 "As time went on, many natives increasingly saw contact with foreigners as evil.  The foreigners brought war and disease, and even far from their settlements the natives would fight over access to trade goods.  Around the 1830s, groups of young men in the Great Plains began joining a warrior society called 'Dog Soldiers', dedicating themselves to fighting foreign influence.  This meant eschewing the metal goods of the foreigners and fighting with traditional weapons.  Unlike earlier generations, they also fought with the knowledge of how the enemy worked, and their weaknesses."
 north_american_circle_cavalry:1 "Circle Cavalry"
 north_american_circle_cavalryDESCR:1 "As natives adopted firearms, they found ways of using them on horseback.  Some braves shortened muskets in order to wield them while mounted, decorating them in order to invoke spirit medicine while fighting.  Because gunpowder weapons had long loading times, they developed a circular formation when fighting.  The braves would ride their horses in a circle, with only one side near the enemy - not around the enemy as popular media suggests.  Upon reaching this point, they would fire their guns, then ride around the circle behind their own lines in order to reload without being shot at."
 north_american_rifle_infantry:1 "Rifle Warriors"
 north_american_rifle_infantryDESCR:1 "With the introduction of the breech-loaded rifle, guns finally replaced the bow among native warriors.  A rifled musket was highly accurate even at long range, even more so than a bow and arrow.  This allowed tribes with even a few rifles to pick off enemies without suffering losses of their own, allowing them to push into their lands.  Unable to produce the guns themselves, the natives were unable to bring many to bear in a battle.  One estimate in the nineteenth century recorded half the warriors using bows, a quarter using rifles and a quarter using older muskets."
 north_american_ghost_dancer_infantry:1 "Ghost Dancers"
 north_american_ghost_dancer_infantryDESCR:1 "Realising the danger that foreigners represented, many young braves joined the Ghost Dancers, a religious movement that attempted to unite the tribes against foreigners.  Members pledged to spurn foreign goods and in return were granted spiritual protection against bullets.  Although this did not stop them from being massacred by riflemen, it did give them incredible bravery in battle."
 north_american_mounted_infantry:1 "Mounted Infantry"
 north_american_mounted_infantryDESCR:1 "With the introduction of the rifle, guns became the weapon of choice for mounted warriors.  The carbine rifle was shorter than a typical musket and so could be fired from horseback with reasonable accuracy, although most still used bows.  It also allowed them to dismount and serve as mounted infantry with better accuracy.  More important than these new weapons was new tactics developed to deal with gun-using enemies: knowing that rifles could jam when overheated, they would send decoys across their line of fire at long range, letting it attract their fire before launching a spear-mounted charge that could close the distance before the enemy could fix their weapons."
 north_american_wave_cavalry:1 "Wave Cavalry"
 north_american_wave_cavalryDESCR:1 "The legendary Crazy Horse developed a tactic for fighting a superior opponent, dividing his men into small groups who would charge at the enemy in staggered waves rather than attacking all at once.  The goal was to isolate smaller enemy units and annihilate them while distracting the main force.  It proved to be a deadly tactic at the battle of Little Big Horn."
 north_american_riflemen_infantry:1 "Rifle Companies"
 north_american_riflemen_infantryDESCR:1 "As firearms became widely available, tribes began adopting them wholeheartedly.

 north_american_regular_infantry:1 "Regulars"
 north_american_regular_infantryDESCR:1 "Although weapons had changed, native tactics were still dominated by the idea of individual combat.  Armies were made up of able-bodied men who hunted for a living, and losing even one meant a permanent loss to the tribe.  As a result, native armies usually had little stomach for losses and often fought without use of tactics.  Realising how effective their enemies were when they fought as units, surviving natives began reorganising their armies, instilling discipline.  This often took the form of hiring a foreigner to drill troops and performing military exercises.  This rankled the braves, but it led to success on the battlefield - something which could excuse almost anything."

These conscript troops did not have the training or discipline of regulars and were often distrusted by their commanders. With more accurate and faster guns making pike screens unnecessary, some commanders began using these men as irregular infantry who operated as marksmen and skirmishers in small units around the main army. These irregular skirmishers could help scout unfamiliar terrain, pin down enemy units until the main force could arrive, and best of all, were expendable.

 mesoamerican_archer_infantryDESCR:1 "After the fall of the Toltec Empire, Mesoamerican armies adopted the bow and arrow as their primary weapon.  Unarmoured archers carried a short bow made of wood with quivers of obsidian tipped arrows made of reeds.  Arrows were lighter than sling stones, yet had the same effective distance.  Their main advantage was that archers could stand in close formation, allowing them to concentrate fire against an enemy.  Since archers could not fire into their own men, both sides would charge the other to avoid being hit with volleys of arrows.  This made the nobles, trained in melee combat, the key to victory.  Wearing quilted cotton armour covered in feathers and carrying clubs or spears, they fought each other in personal displays of courage, trying to break through the enemy's front line.  The aim of combat was to capture an enemy alive, since doing so meant advancement through the ranks."
 mesoamerican_jungle_raider_infantry:1 "Jungle Raiders"
 mesoamerican_jungle_raider_infantryDESCR:1 "The Jungles of Mesoamerica made fighting with ranged weapons or in tight formations impractical.  Instead, armies there consisted of small numbers of armoured nobles supported by unarmoured commoners.  Nobles wore quilted cotton armour, but each carried a weapon of his choice - anything from a fire-hardened spear or club to a copper axe.  Commoners carried leather shields, bows and atlatls and fought to support the nobles, making sure they were not captured alive.  Since these tactics resulted in small armies, they focused on hit-and-run raids rather than pitched battles.  When they did fight, they preferred to attack from the flanks."
 mesoamerican_jaguar_warrior_infantry:1 "Jaguar Warriors"
 mesoamerican_jaguar_warrior_infantryDESCR:1 "As it became clear how effective archers were, Mesoamerican armies adapted by developing heavier weapons for their noble armoured infantry.  The most powerful was a kind of oak broadsword studded with obsidian blades, called macuahuitl by the Aztecs and hadzab by the Maya.  It meant fighting two-handed, giving up a shield or atlatl, but allowed for devastating charges.  Their primary tactic was to wear down an opponent's front line until a weakness emerged, then exploit it and attack the unprotected archers and slingers.  Warriors often fought to the death, knowing that it was infinitely better than being captured alive. They wore coloured feathers on top of their quilted cotton armour in the form of the warrior society they belonged to, such as the elite Jaguar Warriors of the Aztecs."
 mesoamerican_captured_cavalry:1 "Captured Horses"
 mesoamerican_captured_cavalryDESCR:1 "At first the appearance of horses caused panic among Mesoamericans whose weapons and tactics were all aimed against infantry.  Soon, however, they came to realise that if they could capture a horse, they could use it against the Europeans.  These first riders lacked experience or weapons suited to mounted combat, but made up for it with enthusiasm."
 mesoamerican_ranged_infantry:1 "Ranged Infantry"
 mesoamerican_ranged_infantryDESCR:1 "Facing drilled troops carrying gunpowder weapons, Mesoamerican leaders soon realised they had two choices: avoid open warfare with the enemy or adopt the enemy's tactics as their own.  The Maya chose the former option, relying on their traditional bows and atlatls from hiding, launching ambush attacks and then fading away into the jungles where cavalry could not follow and guns would be ineffective.  Although melee troops were necessary to keep an enemy at bay, they were no longer the focus of combat.  Instead, archers and spear-throwers focused on killing as many as they could before retreating."

The Chichimeca chose the latter option, capturing horses and guns and training their troops in fighting European style.  They were remarkably effective, winning pitched battles against garrison troops.  Only their lack of numbers and supplies kept them from winning the war against the invaders."
 mesoamerican_guerilla_infantry:1 "Guerrillas"
 mesoamerican_guerilla_infantryDESCR:1 "It was inevitable that some foreigners would choose to defect, living among the Mesoamericans and sharing their secrets.  With knowledge of their strengths and weaknesses, guns, steel and horses were not invincible - although the natives still lacked their own in large numbers.  To make up for this weakness, they made good use of surprise and camouflage, setting up ambushes and refusing to fight pitched battles.  When they did have to fight, they wore quilted cotton armour stuffed with rock salt, which was able to stop bullets and arrows."
 mesoamerican_dragoon_cavalry:1 "Dragoons"
 mesoamerican_dragoon_cavalryDESCR:1 "As they became more comfortable riding horses, Mesoamerican leaders saw the advantage in being able to move forces more quickly than traditional infantry could travel.

Troops trained to fight with them, and gradually the bow was abandoned in favour of muskets.

 mesoamerican_gallop_cavalry:1 "Gallop Cavalry"
 mesoamerican_gallop_cavalryDESCR:1 "Armies trained in Western European warfare quite often came out second best in combat against pistol armed cavalry in Eastern Europe. Faced with superior cavalry in the Polish Wars, the Swedish army developed Gallop Cavalry to compensate.  Although still armed with pistols like the Caracole, Gallop cavalry did not discharge the pistols as preliminary to shock action but as part of the charge itself. The results were devastating during the Thirty Years' War."
 mesoamerican_soldaty_infantry:1 "Soldaty Charge Infantry"
 mesoamerican_soldaty_infantryDESCR:1 "The Square formation was popular but had its limitations. It resulted in slow-moving, dense formations of arquebusiers that abandoned control of the battlefield to more manoeuvrable opponents. Countries that relied on infantry to take the offensive abandoned the Square and adopted Soldaty tactics for their musketeers, combining muskets and halberds to take the battle to their enemy."
 mesoamerican_irregular_infantry:1 "Musketeer Irregulars"
 mesoamerican_irregular_infantryDESCR:1 "Lighter and handier matchlock muskets replaced the older arquebus. Muskets could fire a two-ounce ball nearly two hundred yards, making them much deadlier on the battlefield. However, the fifteen-pound guns were bulky and required a forked stick to rest the barrel on when firing, making loading complicated and lengthy.  Acting as irregulars, musketeers could take the initiative on the battlefield with their increased firepower and range.  It was this tactic which enabled the French Bluecoats to take the initiative on the battlefield and win countless battles."
 mesoamerican_volley_infantry:1 "Volley Fire Musketeers"
 mesoamerican_volley_infantryDESCR:1 "During the thirty years war, Sweden's king Gustavus Adolphus revolutionized warfare by training his musketeers vigorously in a new tactic. Instead of using countermarch tactics, the troops were trained to stand in three lines so that at any time one line was kneeling, one line was crouching, and one line was firing at the enemy. This demanded an incredible level of discipline and training to accomplish, making Swedish troops some of the most professional in the world. In addition, regiments were reduced from 3,000 men to a mere 500, making them more manoeuvrable on the battlefield."
 mesoamerican_platoon_infantry:1 "Platoon Fire Musketeers"
 mesoamerican_platoon_infantryDESCR:1 "Bayonets were introduced in the mid-seventeenth century and were gradually refined and made more reliable.  Throughout the seventeenth century tactics remained the same: musketeers advanced slowly on the enemy, pausing to fire volleys at them in an attempt to break the enemy line, allowing cavalry to pursue and mop up the scattered enemy.  When this failed, a bayonet charge and hand-to-hand combat was necessary.  This tactic gradually made pikemen superfluous on the battlefield, and where there had been three pikemen to every musketeer by the beginning of the century, there were five musketeers to every pikemen by its end.  Scottish Highlanders were known for being willing to charge the enemy just as much as shoot at them."

This tactic gradually made pikemen superfluous on the battlefield, and where there had been three pikemen to every musketeer by the beginning of the century, there were five musketeers to every pikemen by its end.  British Redcoats used their bayonets to keep the enemy at bay while picking them off with musket fire."
 mesoamerican_carabinier_cavalry:1 "Carabiniers"
 mesoamerican_carabinier_cavalryDESCR:1 "The Carabiniers first came into being in the late sixteenth century and were a type of heavy cavalry that had many things in common with Cuirassiers. They also wore protective armour, though slightly less than a Cuirassier. The main difference between the two cavalry forces was their armament. A Carabinier's main weapon was the carbine, a short wheellock handgun. In addition to the carbine, they were also armed with a sword."
 mesoamerican_armeblanche_cavalry:1 "Arme Blanche Cavalry"
 mesoamerican_armeblanche_cavalryDESCR:1 "While the hussar Cavalry represented the balance between fire and shock and the Dragoon cavalry relied primarily on their muskets, Arme Blanche cavalry relied primarily on cold steel. The bold charges of these units could shatter enemy formations."
 mesoamerican_bayonet_infantry:1 "Bayonet Infantry"
 mesoamerican_bayonet_infantryDESCR:1 "The use of volley tactics, the introduction of safer, more reliable flintlock muskets and the use of bayonets in close combat eliminated the need for pikemen on the battlefield by the turn of the eighteenth century, and soon new tactics were developed to suit.  Now that musketeers had reliable bayonets, infantry charges were once again a viable strategy in battle, allowing them to once again claim the initiative on the battlefield."
 mesoamerican_skirmisher_infantry:1 "Irregular Skirmishers"
 mesoamerican_skirmisher_infantryDESCR:1 "Standing armies were small, and even in the seventeenth century levies were called upon during wartime to make up the bulk of the army. These conscript troops did not have the training or discipline of regulars and were often distrusted by their commanders. With more accurate and faster guns making pike screens unnecessary, some commanders began using these men as irregular infantry who operated as marksmen and skirmishers in small units around the main army. These irregular skirmishers could help scout unfamiliar terrain, pin down enemy units until the main force could arrive, and best of all, were expendable. Austria in particular made great use of their 'Grenzers', who made up over a quarter of the Austrian army."
 mesoamerican_uhlan_cavalry:1 "Uhlans"
 mesoamerican_uhlan_cavalryDESCR:1 "The first Uhlans were created in the early eighteenth century. They were used primarily for reconnaissance for the more heavily armoured cavalry, as well as being assigned to skirmishes. Later on they became an essential part of the military structure due to their light armour, making them fast and agile on the battlefield, and for their high shock value against their enemies.  Uhlan cavalry were a good alternative to large infantry armies as they were not only heavy hitting but also more cost effective. This allowed smaller nations with less manpower to actually put up an effective fight, as armies on foot were also slower compared to their mounted counterparts."
 mesoamerican_hunter_cavalry:1 "Hunter Cavalry"
 mesoamerican_hunter_cavalryDESCR:1 "Hunter cavalry were lightly armoured units trained for rapid action.  They specialised in skirmishes and were renowned for their shooting skills.  They proved so useful during the shifting lines of battle that the French army developed these 'Chasseur à Cheval' into a significant part of their cavalry."
 mesoamerican_mass_infantry:1 "Mass Infantry"
 mesoamerican_mass_infantryDESCR:1 "A favourite of the Russians, highly drilled Mass Infantry could be relied on to charge while under fire without breaking, resulting in terrible casualties for the enemy if it succeeded in reaching enemy lines. The bayonet and constant drill brought back the charge tactic in force: mass infantry launched a devastating volley of fire at their enemy, then set their bayonets and charged.  The result could be deadly to their enemies when it succeeded - or deadly to their own side if it failed."
 mesoamerican_rifled_infantry:1 "Rifled Infantry"
 mesoamerican_rifled_infantryDESCR:1 "Smooth-bore firearms like the musket were notoriously inaccurate, often off by more than a foot at fifty yards.  This meant that musketeers had to fight in tight groups that were vulnerable to increasingly deadly artillery fire. The solution was to introduce rifled muskets that added spin to a bullet and made it fly straight, making these 'rifles' much more accurate and deadly at ranges where a regular musket would be completely ineffective. The downside was that reloading such a gun was time-consuming - a rifle could get off only one shot for every three musket balls - so riflemen were trained to fight in pairs, one shooting while the other reloaded. Although rifles had been put into use by the late eighteenth century, their cost and disadvantages made them relatively rare until much later.  Riflemen such as the Prussian Jaegers, French Voltigeurs or British Greenjackets made excellent sharpshooters and snipers, but because they fought in smaller groups were unable to protect themselves from cavalry.  Most armies maintained small numbers of riflemen in each brigade to compensate for each other's weaknesses."
 mesoamerican_columnar_infantry:1 "Columnar Infantry"
 mesoamerican_columnar_infantryDESCR:1 "Revolutionary France relied on conscript soldiers for the bulk of their army. To give these green troops confidence in battle they placed them in a single column that marched steadily forward toward the enemy to the beat of hundreds of drums. The column presented a thin target that could turn to form a line or dig into entrenchments that protected them from enemy attack.  The men in front would be killed by enemy fire, but eventually the men would climb over the bodies of their own dead and break through enemy lines.  Although losses could be high, columns often won against other formations through sheer stubbornness and force of numbers."

 mesoamerican_breech_infantry:1 "Breech-Loaded Riflemen"
 mesoamerican_breech_infantryDESCR:1 "Nearly all early firearms were muzzle-loaded, or loaded from the front. This made even the more advanced guns slow to reload, a critical factor in battle. The first mass-produced breech-loader (back-loaded guns) began appearing in the nineteenth century and made combat much deadlier. Where before a well-trained soldier could fire as many as four shots a minute, even a poorly trained soldier could fire faster with a breech-loaded rifle.  This had the effect of making a single soldier much deadlier than ever before."
 mesoamerican_jominian_infantry:1 "Jominian Infantry"
 mesoamerican_jominian_infantryDESCR:1 "As armies grew in the years following the Napoleonic Wars, so too did the need to properly deploy these armies.  One leading military thinker, Antoine-Henri Jomini, placed heavy emphasis on the concentration of troops with 'interior lines' from which it would be easy to mass power on specific points in the enemy's lines.  In practise, this led to mass charges in order to overwhelm enemy defences.  While this did have the downside of removing emphasis from firepower, many nations were distrustful of a faster rate of fire, fearing troops would expend their ammunition too quickly and flee. These tactics formed the basis of the French, Russian, Austrian, and American military schools well into the nineteenth century."
 southamerican_club_infantryDESCR:1 "One of the most common weapons in the Andes was the mace.  There were many varieties, from smaller ones to massive, two-handed ones called Porra.  Tipped with star-shaped stones or copper spikes, they could be deadly close-combat weapons.  Usually the army was divided into heavy clubmen who wore quilted armour studded with copper and light skirmishers who carried lances, slings and axes and wore no armour, but carried small wood and copper shields for protection."
 southamerican_spear_infantryDESCR:1 "One of the most common weapons in the Andes was the spear.  They ranged from short javelins that could be thrown at an enemy at long ranges using an atlatl to the long, heavy spears that were used in melee combat.  Armies that specialised in the spear still had large contingents who used maces, bows and other weapons.  Soldiers wore quilted armour studded with copper for protection and carried small square wooden and copper shields."
 southamerican_central_sling_infantryDESCR:1 "Soldiers were conscripted into the army at a young age, then trained in every weapon before specializing in one.  In some areas, the sling was the weapon of choice.  Slings could throw egg-sized stones at an enemy that was seventy metres away.  Soldiers would fire their slings at the enemy from far away, then switch to melee weapons such as axes and maces when they reached their lines.  They were guarded by spearmen and other melee troops on their flanks."
 southamerican_eastern_archer_infantryDESCR:1 "Soldiers were conscripted into the army at a young age, then trained in every weapon before specializing in one.  In the east, the weapon of choice was the bow.  Soldiers would carry short bows into battle, using them to harass the enemy and keep them away from their lines.  When the enemy reached them, they would switch to close combat weapons such as axes or maces.  Spearmen and other soldiers protected their flanks."
 southamerican_southern_bolo_infantryDESCR:1 "Soldiers were conscripted into the army at a young age, then trained in every weapon before specializing in one.  In the south, the weapon of choice was the bola (ayullu) - a lasso that tied together three stone balls that could be thrown at an enemy and entangle his arms or legs.  When an enemy charged them, soldiers would throw their bolas to slow down the enemy before launching other missiles at them.  When the enemy reached their lines, they would switch to axes and maces."
 southamerican_mixed_sling_infantryDESCR:1 "With growing contact and conflict in the Andes, victorious armies began adopting the weapons of defeated enemies.  In this way imperial armies had a large variety of weapons.  One group would be comprised of specialists - slingers who could launch egg-sized stones at the enemy from long range.  They each carried a bola that they would throw first, entangling charging enemies and making them easy prey for the rain of stones.  Enemies that reached their lines would be met by the second group, made up of a large variety of soldiers - archers, clubmen, axemen, and spearmen."
 southamerican_mixed_bow_infantryDESCR:1 "With growing contact and conflict in the Andes, victorious armies began adopting the weapons of defeated enemies.  In this way imperial armies had a large variety of weapons.  One group would be comprised of specialists - archers who could fire arrows with stone arrowheads rapidly at the enemy from far away.  Enemies that reached their lines would be met by the second group, made up of a large variety of soldiers - slingers, clubmen, axemen, and spearmen."
 southamerican_guerilla_infantryDESCR:1 "Faced with mounted enemies that could launch unstoppable charges, Inca armies had to adapt or die.  After several losing battles, they abandoned the idea of frontal combat and began to fight using guerrilla tactics.  They attempted to fight in terrain unsuited for horses: narrow mountain passes or thick jungles - even flooding grasslands to turn them into swamps.  When possible, they would lay ambushes, attacking from hiding with missile weapons.  When forced into an open confrontation, they would dig holes and fill them with spikes and make walls of earth and spears to ward off the enemy.  They fought with slings, maces, and a wide variety of other weapons, occasionally using captured enemy weapons as well."
 southamerican_reformed_imperial_infantryDESCR:1 "Becoming more familiar with cavalry and gunpowder armies, South Americans began to use old weapons in new ways.  They had always had spears, used both as javelins and in close combat.  Now they began to use long spears which could be braced in the earth to stop a cavalry charge cold, while rear troops threw bolas at the horses, attempting to bring them down where they could be slaughtered or captured.  Meanwhile, an increasingly large number of troops carried weapons captured from the enemy.  While the weapons did not make a large difference in battle, they removed the mystique and fear generated by enemies that carried them."
 southamerican_captured_cavalryDESCR:1 "Through ambush or deception, native armies occasionally got their hands on enemy horses.  Using captured enemy soldiers, they learned how to ride them.  At first this was a privilege for rulers only - a sign that the enemy was not unbeatable as well as of royalty.  As the number of horses increased, elite mounted units were formed.  These units rode horses into battle but found it difficult to coordinate them or fight from horseback.  In effect they acted as messengers, helped officers move around the battlefield and allowed the army to take advantage of changes on the field of battle more quickly."
 southamerican_westernized_infantryDESCR:1 "Impressed by the effectiveness of foreign armies, surviving native armies trained in the tactics and weapons of the foreigners themselves.  Using captured weapons and enemy soldiers, they trained in the use of the new weapons until they became proficient in their use.  They lacked sufficient supplies and could not make use of whole-regiment tactics the way their enemies could, but they carried muskets alongside their maces and axes."
 southamerican_regular_cavalryDESCR:1 "A growing familiarity with horses allowed native armies to field actual cavalry - troops trained in fighting from horseback.  They could launch charges against an enemy line, chase down fleeing opponents, and skirmish with enemy cavalry to protect the flanks.  Although they were still inferior to foreign cavalry, they represented a massive step forward and allowed armies to experiment with different tactics on the battlefield."

 southamerican_freeshooter_infantryDESCR:1 "As guns became deadlier and more common on battlefields, charge infantry changed tactics. They were still trained and equipped to fight up-close, but they deliberately waited for the enemy to shoot before charging. Because guns could take so long to reload, they could often close the distance before the enemy had a chance to fire twice, and both arquebuses and muskets were notoriously inaccurate at longer ranges. This strategy was risky but paid off handsomely when it succeeded."
 southamerican_cuirassier_cavalry:1 "Cuirassiers"
 southamerican_cuirassier_cavalryDESCR:1 "The Cuirassiers was a type of heavy cavalry that evolved from the armoured knight. This type of cavalry was armoured from his head down to knee-level. His body was protected with a breastplate, or 'Cuirass', from which they took their name. The breastplate was designed to withstand not only the shot from a pistol but also that of ball fired from a musket. They were armed with wheellock pistols, lances and swords. Cuirassiers were mostly used as shock troops and were in use for centuries."
 southamerican_tercio_infantry:1 "Tercio Infantry"
 southamerican_tercio_infantryDESCR:1 "Early Square formations relied on pikemen to support a small number of arquebusiers, but as guns became deadlier and more reliable the number of arquebusiers in the square grew and the number of pikemen shrank from 2:1 to 1:2. By the end of the century most squares were dominated by arquebusiers, gaining increased firepower without sacrificing defence. This helped to keep the Tercio the predominant tactic used on the battlefield in Western Europe."
 southamerican_gallop_cavalry:1 "Gallop Cavalry"
 southamerican_gallop_cavalryDESCR:1 "Armies trained in Western European warfare quite often came out second best in combat against pistol armed cavalry in Eastern Europe. Faced with superior cavalry in the Polish Wars, the Swedish army developed Gallop Cavalry to compensate.  Although still armed with pistols like the Caracole, Gallop cavalry did not discharge the pistols as preliminary to shock action but as part of the charge itself. The results were devastating during the Thirty Years' War."
 southamerican_irregular_infantry:1 "Musketeer Irregulars"
 southamerican_irregular_infantryDESCR:1 "Lighter and handier matchlock muskets replaced the older arquebus. Muskets could fire a two-ounce ball nearly two hundred yards, making them much deadlier on the battlefield. However, the fifteen-pound guns were bulky and required a forked stick to rest the barrel on when firing, making loading complicated and lengthy.  Acting as irregulars, musketeers could take the initiative on the battlefield with their increased firepower and range.  It was this tactic which enabled the French Bluecoats to take the initiative on the battlefield and win countless battles."
 southamerican_dragoon_cavalry:1 "Dragoons"
 southamerican_dragoon_cavalryDESCR:1 "In the seventeenth century, a new type of cavalry called Dragoons was created. Dragoons were basically infantry who transported themselves by horse. The name Dragoon comes from the weapon they carried a short type of musket or carbine, called dragon. Dragoons were widely used by all European nations mostly because they were cheaper than normal cavalry."
 southamerican_countermarch_infantry:1 "Countermarch Musketeers"
 southamerican_countermarch_infantryDESCR:1 "Although they were reaching parity with bows, muskets were still a risky weapon to rely on because once fired it took a long time to reload. Pikemen were required to protect the musketeers during reloading, limiting their offensive power. This changed in the early seventeenth century when Maurice of Nassau divided his musketeers into six ranks. The front rank fired, then moved to the back to reload while the next rank took their turn, and in so doing allowed the regiment to be firing at the enemy constantly. This required a great deal of training to be able to work together and a familiarity with their weapons, and to accomplish this, standard terms of command were introduced to guarantee uniformity."
 southamerican_volley_infantry:1 "Volley Fire Musketeers"
 southamerican_volley_infantryDESCR:1 "During the thirty years war, Sweden's king Gustavus Adolphus revolutionized warfare by training his musketeers vigorously in a new tactic. Instead of using countermarch tactics, the troops were trained to stand in three lines so that at any time one line was kneeling, one line was crouching, and one line was firing at the enemy. This demanded an incredible level of discipline and training to accomplish, making Swedish troops some of the most professional in the world. In addition, regiments were reduced from 3,000 men to a mere 500, making them more manoeuvrable on the battlefield."

When this failed, a bayonet charge and hand-to-hand combat was necessary.  This tactic gradually made pikemen superfluous on the battlefield, and where there had been three pikemen to every musketeer by the beginning of the century, there were five musketeers to every pikemen by its end.

At the battle of Adrianople, the cream of Western European nobility met the Ottoman light cavalry and was soundly defeated by their superior mobility.  In comparison, the Hungarians and Poles used lighter cavalry called Hussars that had more success.

They carried a rider - usually an officer or noble - and a mahout (driver and attendant) in a howdah on the elephant's back.  The elephants helped generals to see the battle properly, but could also be devastating in charges.  They were useful against cavalry as well, since horses would refuse to get close to the mammoths.  However, when an elephant was in pain or lost its mahout it could go into a frenzy and devastate friendly forces, making it a two-edged sword."

Since they were not locals and were paid by the Sultan, they would be loyal to him alone, in theory.  They wore mail armour and carried spears, maces and daggers.  They were trained to make feigned retreats, flank the enemy, and loose arrows at him."
 indian_pike_infantry:1 "Pikemen"
 indian_pike_infantryDESCR:1 "Arriving with the Muslim invaders, horses were a powerful weapon on the battlefield.  Surviving Indian nations found ways to fight cavalry.  Their infantry continued to carry the traditional mix of swords, spears and bows, but now emphasised javelins and lances made of Wootz steel which could help to fend off horses.  Archers carried bows, daggers and battle axes."
 indian_bow_infantry:1 "Archers"
 indian_bow_infantryDESCR:1 "North Indian troops who carried a mix of swords, spears and bows, but fought mainly as archers using the traditional bamboo longbow of India."
 indian_nayaka_infantry:1 "Nayaka Infantry"
 indian_nayaka_infantryDESCR:1 "The Nayaka were military governors who collected taxes from the population, but were required to use that money to maintain an army for the nation.  These armies were required to parade through the capital during festivals, and if found to be either under- or over-strength, the Nayaka would be punished severely.  Their armies were infantry who carried swords, javelins and curved Turkish bows.  They applied oil to their bodies before fighting and carried shields to protect themselves, but otherwise wore no armour."
 indian_jagirdar_infantry:1 "Jagirdar Infantry"
 indian_jagirdar_infantryDESCR:1 "Feudal levies who were attached to a noble who owned a fief (jagir) in return for service during war.  The fief was only held for life, and only while service was provided.  Jagirdars owed their loyalty to their liege and were supplied by him, so they could vary a great deal.  Most carried a mix of traditional weapons including spears, swords, javelins and bows, and some wore armour.  A few carried blunderbusses, but these gunpowder weapons were seen as cowardly and shunned by the warrior castes."
 indian_rajput_camelry:1 "Camelry"
 indian_rajput_camelryDESCR:1 "Baluchi tribes were willing to fight for pay, forming units of riders who fought with javelins and spears from atop their camels."
 indian_tumandar_cavalry:1 "Tumandar Cavalry"
 indian_tumandar_cavalryDESCR:1 "The Tumandar were Muslims from military families who provided their own horses and were recruited as high-paid cavalry.  They fought in disciplined Mongol style, charging close to loose arrows at the enemy, then retreating again.  In many ways this style of warfare was unchanged since the days of Genghis Khan, but one innovation was their use of 'water-proof' composite bows, a requirement to avoid the bows falling apart in the humid tropics of India."
 indian_armored_elephant_cavalry:1 "Armoured Elephants"
 indian_armored_elephant_cavalryDESCR:1 "As firearms became deadlier on the battlefield, war elephants became targets for the enemy.  In reaction, war elephants wore iron cuirasses to protect them from bullets, although they still needed close-up protection.  This was provided by infantrymen whose job was to protect its flanks and by an even larger howdah which contained eight men per elephant, four on each side, armed with bows and muskets.  Finally, the elephants had knives attached to their tusks, giving them an additional edge in battle.  This once again placed them in the role of shock troops who could charge at enemy lines to devastating result."
 indian_fauj_infantry:1 "Fauj Infantry"
 indian_fauj_infantryDESCR:1 "Traditional Indian armies were feudal, but this system had its weaknesses.  Feudal troops were loyal to their liege, not to the ruler, and their equipment and training varied.  The Fauj (district) system attempted to rectify these flaws by establishing an army in each district of the empire.  Each Jagirdar had to maintain a roll of soldiers under his command with descriptive names so that he could not hide the number or type of troops under his command.  Most fought with sword, spear and bow, but about a quarter were armed with matchlock muskets.  They still fought mostly as individuals, but were trained to level their spears against enemy cavalry and struck them together to spook the horses."
 indian_dakhili_infantry:1 "Dakhili Infantry"
 indian_dakhili_infantryDESCR:1 "Infantry archers paid and supplied directly by the state.  Most were armed with bows and steel crossbows that could punch through armour, but one in four carried a matchlock musket instead.  A few also had rockets, which were carried on camels and could be fired at a range of 1,000 yards.  Some of the rockets were explosive and could kill a man or horse, while others skimmed the ground to frighten enemy horses."
 indian_kshatriya_cavalry:1 "Kshatriya Cavalry"
 indian_kshatriya_cavalryDESCR:1 "Originally all cavalry were Muslim, but eventually a professional Hindu cavalry caste emerged in India.  These men were largely from the militant Kshatriya caste and were eager to fight as warriors.  They were allowed to train and fight under their own rajas as long as they fought for the empire loyally.  They wore quilted tunics with leather cushioned by silk, and wore battle-axes and daggers in their belts for close combat.  They valued bravery and fought primarily with javelins."
 indian_tabinan_cavalry:1 "Tabinan Cavalry"
 indian_tabinan_cavalryDESCR:1 "As cavalry became more common, regular cavalry armies were raised as part of feudal obligations.  A Mansabdar who owned a fief (jagir) would buy horses, often from Arabia or Persia, and hire men from his own caste and ethnicity to serve as cavalrymen.  Since the horses were so expensive, they were branded so that the men could not sell them.  The Tabinan (regular cavalrymen) spent hours every day training in swordsmanship, weight-lifting and riding, but fought as individuals rather than as a unit.  Their primary weapon was a fifteen-foot spear."
 indian_banduqchi_infantry:1 "Banduqchi Musketeers"
 indian_banduqchi_infantryDESCR:1 "As gunpowder weapons proved their deadliness and began to be produced in large numbers, increasingly Indian armies began adopting the weapons in place of more traditional bows or spears.  Unlike westerners, Indian armies preferred the matchlock musket over the flintlock, since it was more reliable in the humid conditions of India.  The bulk of the army remained a mix of swords, spears and bows, however, and the musketeers fought largely as individuals, limiting their effectiveness on the battlefield.  Another reason they took so long to catch on was the fact that Indian gunpowder was of poor quality, causing guns to become fouled easily.  This meant the weapons were unreliable in battle, forcing soldiers to rely on more traditional weapons or risk disaster."
 indian_mansabdar_cavalry:1 "Mansabdar Cavalry"
 indian_mansabdar_cavalryDESCR:1 "As time went on, the Mansabdar system grew in popularity.  In response, the size of each fief was cut so that the cavalry units maintained by each mansabdar were smaller and more flexible.  This also decreased the effect of treachery or rebellion by a Mansabdar.  Even with this change, so many young noblemen applied to be Mansabdars that the army could not find posts for them all.  Instead, it created a new rank: Ahadi, or Gentleman Trooper.  The Ahadis served as messengers and elite bodyguards, hoping that their service would be rewarded by promotion to Mansabdar."
 indian_zamindar_cavalry:1 "Zamindar Irregular Cavalry"
 indian_zamindar_cavalryDESCR:1 "Rather than having rajas with large armies, the empire was divided into small fiefs (jagir), some of which were granted to Hindu nobles called Zamindars for life in return for maintaining a cavalry army.  Each Zamindar paid to import horses, recruit men and supply them, and in return collected taxes from the region.  These cavalry fought as irregular cavalry, largely with javelins and swords."
 indian_silhedar_cavalry:1 "Silhedar Cavalry"
 indian_silhedar_cavalryDESCR:1 "It was expensive to import horses, so a man who owned his own horse - a Silhedar, or Equipment Holder - could demand high wages.  As horses became more common on the subcontinent, Silhedars also became common.  Some formed condotteries and served as mercenaries - professional soldiers who fought for pay rather than loyalty to a liege.  Governments attempted to win their loyalty by awarding their leaders jagirs, hoping to entice them to become part of the existing feudal system, but the Silhedar cavalry themselves were always independent agents.  They fought much as their feudal comrades did, but were generally better armoured and armed.  At their height, they made up two-thirds of all cavalry."
 indian_sepoy_musketeer_infantry:1 "Sepoy Musketeers"
 indian_sepoy_musketeer_infantryDESCR:1 "With the constant wars of the subcontinent it should come as no surprise that generals gained more experience in using gunpowder weapons.  Their Sepoys were still armed with a mix of traditional and gunpowder weapons, but the gunpowder weapons they did use were becoming deadlier.  Not all experiments met with success, and the quality of gunpowder was still inferior to the West, but a variety of successful new weapons emerged in this period: ban rockets, ghabarah mortars, and huqqah-i atish grenades."
 indian_mawle_infantry:1 "Mawle Infantry"
 indian_mawle_infantryDESCR:1 "Realising the weakness of the feudal system, some nations attempted to abolish jagirs and replace them with a centralised army.  They introduced strict discipline, enforcing idleness in the barracks during monsoon season and campaigns and drills the other eight months.  Regular troops were bolstered by Westerners enticed to join the ranks through promises of high pay and special treatment, although most volunteers were criminals and deserters.  The state promised to pay and provision them, in return for which all booty from raids belonged to the state.  This worked well at times, but soldiers often ended up owed months of wages and provisions were scanty at the best of times, without even tents provided.  The men wore turbans, jackets and tight-fitting trousers, but no armour.  Officers wore helmets and chain or padding.  Since they were so lightly armed, the men could cover as much as 50 miles in a single march.  Used to hard conditions, their superior discipline and fast speed compensated for their light armour."
 indian_qazaqi_cavalry:1 "Qazaqi Raiders"
 indian_qazaqi_cavalryDESCR:1 "The Qazaqi were light horsemen whose job was to raid the enemy lines when they spotted a weak point.  They could travel quickly and attack from range, carrying bows as well as matchlock muskets.  Simply by being present at a battle they could restrict enemy movement, but when they were able to attack a fleeing enemy the casualties could be enormous.  The name is Turkish, from the same root as the Cossack raiders who fought in a similar style."
 indian_bargir_cavalry:1 "Bargir Raiders"
 indian_bargir_cavalryDESCR:1 "In an attempt to eradicate the feudal system, the army began raising cavalry armies directly.  These 'Burden-takers' or Bargirs were paid less than Silhedars, but received their horses and weapons from the state.  Since they carried few supplies, the Bargirs were able to travel quickly and surprise the enemy.  However, they were lightly armoured and preferred to avoid open battle.  Instead, they attacked the countryside around an enemy army, seizing their supplies for themselves and weakening the enemy at the same time.  Soon they became famous for these harassing raids.  As they grew in number, they were placed in charge of the remaining Silhedars."
 indian_musketeer_elephantry:1 "Gajnal Elephants"
 indian_musketeer_elephantryDESCR:1 "Seeking to take advantage of their relative height and mobility on the battlefield, special heavy muskets called Gajnal were designed for use on elephants.  Eight soldiers armed with these heavy weapons rode in the howdah on back of each elephant, able to fire their guns from range.  The elephants themselves wore lamellar protection over their vulnerable parts, such as their ears, but wore no actual armour.  The elephants were specially trained to not be afraid of gunpowder by having the men fire their weapons right next to it."
 indian_matchlockmen_infantry:1 "Matchlockmen"
 indian_matchlockmen_infantryDESCR:1 "It took centuries, but eventually gunpowder weapons supplanted traditional weapons in India.  Nearly every troop now carried a matchlock musket, although they also carried pikes, swords and bows since gunpowder weapons remained unreliable with the poor quality gunpowder they used.  Matchlocks also remained the weapon of choice since the fuses were more reliable in humid conditions.  Although their firepower increased, the troops still trained and fought as individuals."
 indian_saranjam_infantry:1 "Saranjam Infantry"
 indian_saranjam_infantryDESCR:1 "Attempts to centralise the army had mixed results.  Although such armies were disciplined and effective, they were also consistently owed back wages and supplies.  A strong ruler could keep the army together, but a weak one risked open rebellion by his own forces.  To avoid this, the army was divided into regions, each ruled by a military governor who collected taxes and used the money to maintain an army.  Since the ruler no longer needed to raise an army himself, he received only a small portion of the taxes.  The resulting Saranjam armies were loyal to their governors, not their ruler, and discipline became lax as the warrior elite were able to demand a return to individual honour and bravery."
 indian_ekanda_cavalry:1 "Ekanda Cavalry"
 indian_ekanda_cavalryDESCR:1 "Volunteer cavalry who owned their own horses and so were highly paid for their service.  The Ekanda were armed with a wide variety of weapons including muskets, matchlocks, daggers, clubs, bows, spears, lances and swords.  They mostly fought with sword and shield, able to take a musket-ball from long range and a pistol-ball close up, but they would fire their muskets during bush-fighting before turning and retreating to the main force."
 indian_heavy_cavalry:1 "Heavy Cavalry"
 indian_heavy_cavalryDESCR:1 "In response to the growing use of gunpowder on the battlefield, North Indian and Pathan cavalry wore even heavier armour - mail and plate, riding large horses who could support the extra weight.  This gave them protection against musket balls and allowed them to make devastating charges in battle, but it also made them slow and unable to catch light cavalry."
 indian_cannon_elephantry:1 "Elephant Barrels"
 indian_cannon_elephantryDESCR:1 "War Elephants could withstand musket balls, but a cannon could knock one down at long range.  This made them increasingly vulnerable on the battlefield.  Some rulers responded by designing small cannons that could be carried on an elephant's back, turning them into mobile artillery."
 indian_rocketeer_infantry:1 "Rocketeers"
 indian_rocketeer_infantryDESCR:1 "Continued experiments into gunpowder resulted in the mass production of gunpowder iron rockets that could be carried on a man's back and fired against an enemy.  The rockets were individually weak, but as an addition to the muskets and rifles carried by the men, added a devastating punch to the battle."
 indian_gardi_infantry:1 "Gardi Infantry"
 indian_gardi_infantryDESCR:1 "The Gardi gained their name from the English, French and Portuguese word for 'guard'.  The army attracted European officers to switch sides with offers of high pay and preferred treatment, and those officers then trained the locals in the European fashion.  They wore coats and carried muskets like European soldiers, but their weapons were often defective, missing flints, cocks or locks.  They were paid a salary except during raiding, when they were expected to seize booty for themselves.  Some were musketeers who were trained to fight as a unit, but most fought in more traditional style.  Either way, they were trained to fight pitched battles rather than skirmishes and raids.  However, since they were attracted by pay and not personal loyalty, Gardi officers had a tendency to change sides."
 indian_ganimi_kava_infantry:1 "Ganimi Kava"
 indian_ganimi_kava_infantryDESCR:1 "Coming from a warrior tradition that emphasised personal bravery and honour, Conservative Indians rejected European-style warfare and continued to fight in the traditional style of raiding and avoiding the enemy.  This style, known as Ganimi Kava, emphasised cavalry over infantry, harassing enemies over pitched battles, and light, fast units over heavy and slow armies.  Although they were not as strong as western style armies, they could still win battles against them if they used their advantages properly.  Their biggest weakness, however, was their failure to win sieges.  It was this more than anything else that caused the Ganimi Kava to eventually disappear."
 indian_pindari_cavalry:1 "Pindaris"
 indian_pindari_cavalryDESCR:1 "The Pindari were 'Free Companions' who fought for plunder, not pay.  They were tribal cavalry loosely organised under leaders they chose themselves, usually attached to a particular general or chief rather than being a regular part of the army.  Each carried a few days of provisions and could travel for weeks at thirty to forty miles per day.  They fought as raiders who avoided open battle but were brutally effective at looting supplies.  Unfortunately, they had a tendency to loot friend and foe alike, and since they had little to gain from a pitched battle, sometimes ran away to their country homes if attacked."
 indian_westernized_infantry:1 "Westernised Infantry"
 indian_westernized_infantryDESCR:1 "Gardi troops were trained in European fashion as a unit, but only in the most basic ways.  As the troops became used to it, though, increasingly Indian officers were promoted who ran basic training and manoeuvres, leaving Western-born officers to introduce new tactics from the European wars.  This would be the final step towards a truly modern Indian army."
 indian_uhlan_cavalry:1 "Uhlans"
 indian_uhlan_cavalryDESCR:1 "The first Uhlans were created in the early eighteenth century. They were used primarily for reconnaissance for the more heavily armoured cavalry, as well as being assigned to skirmishes. Later on they became an essential part of the military structure due to their light armour, making them fast and agile on the battlefield, and for their high shock value against their enemies.  Uhlan cavalry were a good alternative to large infantry armies as they were not only heavy hitting but also more cost effective. This allowed smaller nations with less manpower to actually put up an effective fight, as armies on foot were also slower compared to their mounted counterparts."
 indian_drill_infantry:1 "Drill Infantry"
 indian_drill_infantryDESCR:1 "Able to fight at close range or from further away, musketeers were versatile indeed - but only if they could react quickly to the shifting battlefield. Frederick of Prussia trained his men rigorously to deal with any situation that could conceivably come up until they became an incredible fighting force that never broke ranks and could fire as much as one shot every fifteen seconds under combat conditions!  This Prussian Drill infantry became the model army for the rest of the world after its stunning successes in battle and was used by both sides in the American Revolution."
 indian_mass_infantry:1 "Mass Infantry"
 indian_mass_infantryDESCR:1 "A favourite of the Russians, highly drilled Mass Infantry could be relied on to charge while under fire without breaking, resulting in terrible casualties for the enemy if it succeeded in reaching enemy lines. The bayonet and constant drill brought back the charge tactic in force: mass infantry launched a devastating volley of fire at their enemy, then set their bayonets and charged.  The result could be deadly to their enemies when it succeeded - or deadly to their own side if it failed."
 indian_rifled_infantry:1 "Rifled Musketeers"
 indian_rifled_infantryDESCR:1 "Smooth-bore firearms like the musket were notoriously inaccurate, often off by more than a foot at fifty yards.  This meant that musketeers had to fight in tight groups that were vulnerable to increasingly deadly artillery fire. The solution was to introduce rifled muskets that added spin to a bullet and made it fly straight, making these 'rifles' much more accurate and deadly at ranges where a regular musket would be completely ineffective. The downside was that reloading such a gun was time-consuming - a rifle could get off only one shot for every three musket balls - so riflemen were trained to fight in pairs, one shooting while the other reloaded. Although rifles had been put into use by the late eighteenth century, their cost and disadvantages made them relatively rare until much later.  Riflemen such as the Prussian Jaegers, French Voltigeurs or British Greenjackets made excellent sharpshooters and snipers, but because they fought in smaller groups were unable to protect themselves from cavalry.  Most armies maintained small numbers of riflemen in each brigade to compensate for each other's weaknesses."
 indian_columnar_infantry:1 "Columnar Infantry"
 indian_columnar_infantryDESCR:1 "Revolutionary France relied on conscript soldiers for the bulk of their army. To give these green troops confidence in battle they placed them in a single column that marched steadily forward towards the enemy to the beat of hundreds of drums. The column presented a thin target that could turn to form a line or dig into entrenchments that protected them from enemy attack.  The men in front would be killed by enemy fire, but eventually the men would climb over the bodies of their own dead and break through enemy lines.  Although losses could be high, columns often won against other formations through sheer stubbornness and force of numbers."
 indian_impulse_infantry:1 "Impulse Infantry"
 indian_impulse_infantryDESCR:1 "Impulse Infantry relied upon a 'cloud' of light infantry that acted as sharpshooters and skirmishers, keeping the enemy pinned down under fire while the main line advanced into position to charge the enemy line and deliver a coup de grace."
 indian_lancer_cavalry:1 "Lancers"
 indian_lancer_cavalryDESCR:1 "The creme de la creme of the Napoleonic army. Although their lances made them less agile these cavalry troops were formidable adversaries when charging their enemies directly."
 indian_breech_infantry:1 "Breech Loaded Riflemen"
 indian_breech_infantryDESCR:1 "Nearly all early firearms were muzzle-loaded, or loaded from the front. This made even the more advanced guns slow to reload, a critical factor in battle. The first mass-produced breech-loader (back-loaded guns) began appearing in the nineteenth century and made combat much deadlier. Where before a well-trained soldier could fire as many as four shots a minute, even a poorly trained soldier could fire faster with a breech-loaded rifle.  This had the effect of making a single soldier much deadlier than ever before."
 indian_jominian_infantry:1 "Jominian Infantry"
 indian_jominian_infantryDESCR:1 "As armies grew in the years following the Napoleonic Wars, so too did the need to properly deploy these armies.  One leading military thinker, Antoine-Henri Jomini, placed heavy emphasis on the concentration of troops with 'interior lines' from which it would be easy to mass power on specific points in the enemy's lines.  In practise, this led to mass charges in order to overwhelm enemy defences.  While this did have the downside of removing emphasis from firepower, many nations were distrustful of a faster rate of fire, fearing troops would expend their ammunition too quickly and flee. These tactics formed the basis of the French, Russian, Austrian, and American military schools well into the nineteenth century."
 indian_lighthussar_cavalry:1 "Light Hussars"
 indian_lighthussar_cavalryDESCR:1 "As Cavalry became more specialised, the Hussar started to evolve. The Hussar unit became less like the heavy Polish Hussar and more like the light Hungarian original. The ability of these light and mobile troops to find the enemy, harass them, and overrun their artillery more than made up for their lack of armour."
 indian_hunter_cavalry:1 "Hunter Cavalry"
 indian_hunter_cavalryDESCR:1 "Hunter cavalry were lightly armoured units trained for rapid action.  They specialised in skirmishes and were renowned for their shooting skills.  They proved so useful during the shifting lines of battle that the French army developed these 'Chasseur à Cheval' into a significant part of their cavalry."

 ship_light_T15_western_caravela_redondaDESCR:1 "The disadvantage of the caravel was its small size, preventing it from keeping large stores or crew for long voyages.  In order to travel to distant lands, larger carracks were built in caravel style, with four masts flying square sails.

 ship_galley_T27_western_galleassDESCR:1 "Based on large merchant galleys, Galleasses were larger, slower and heavier than regular galleys.  This went counter to the theme of shallow but fast galleys, but it allowed Galleasses to maintain large batteries of guns on their broadsides that could devastate enemy ships.  In order to keep up with speed, Galleasses also maintained sails.  This meant that they were more unreliable than oar-powered galleys, but when they were used effectively - like at Lepanto in 1583 - they could be powerful indeed."

 ship_galley_T27_muslim_galliotDESCR:1 "A two-masted ship with both sails and oars, the Galliot was used by the Barbary pirates between the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries."
 ship_galley_T27_indian_gallivat:1 "Gallivat"
 ship_galley_T27_indian_gallivatDESCR:1 "A small armed ship with both sails and oars, used on the Malabar coast in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the Gallivat had one or two masts with lateen sails.  They were used extensively by the Maratha navy to tow Grabs and carry extra men for boarding actions."
 ship_heavy_T27_western_heavy_galleon:1 "Heavy Galleon"
 ship_heavy_T27_western_heavy_galleonDESCR:1 "As time went on, most maritime nations adopted the Galleon as their primary warship.  It soon became apparent that larger Galleons were able to consistently defeat smaller ones, and the size of Galleys increased in order to maintain a larger complement of guns."
 ship_light_T30_western_brigantine:1 "Brigantine"
 ship_light_T30_western_brigantineDESCR:1 "A two-masted vessel, the brigantine was originally a sail-and-oared pirate ship.  By the seventeenth century Atlantic maritime nations began using the term to refer to two-masted sailing ships using a particular kind of square-sailed rigging.  Brigantines were fast ships, larger than caravels and so able to carry more guns."
 ship_light_T30_chinese_lorcha:1 "Lorcha"
 ship_light_T30_chinese_lorchaDESCR:1 "A type of sailing ship which combined a Junk rig on a European-style hull.  Because of this combination, the ship was faster than pirate ships and could carry more cargo than other Junks, while the rigging made it easy to handle with a small crew and cheap to construct or repair."
 ship_light_T35_western_early_frigate:1 "Frigate-built Ship"
 ship_light_T35_western_early_frigateDESCR:1 "In the seventeenth century, any ship built for speed and manoeuvrability was said to be 'frigate-built'.  They were typically warships that were too small to be considered ships of the line, with all their guns on a single deck.  While unable to stand up to a first-rate ship of the line, frigates were speedy and well-armed, making them ideal messengers and pirate hunters."
 ship_light_T35_chinese_red_seal:1 "Red Seal Ship"
 ship_light_T35_chinese_red_sealDESCR:1 "An armed merchant ship that ranged from 500 to 750 tons, equal or superior to European galleons.  The ships combined European, Chinese and Japanese hull designs.  They gained their name from the system of trading permits allowing them to ply the trade throughout Asia."
 ship_light_T35_indian_ghurab:1 "Ghurab"

 ship_galley_T36_western_polacca:1 "Polacca Xebec"
 ship_galley_T36_western_polaccaDESCR:1 "A ship-rigged galley that used both sails and oars for propulsion.  They were relatively small ships but very fast due to their narrow floors and large sails.  This allowed them to fight effectively as corsairs and pirates, and even to fight frigates in coastal waters.  Polacca Xebecs, commonly used in Europe, used square sails."
 ship_galley_T36_muslim_two_masted_xebec:1 "Xebec"
 ship_galley_T36_muslim_two_masted_xebecDESCR:1 "A ship-rigged galley that used both sails and oars for propulsion.  They were relatively small ships but very fast due to their narrow floors and large sails.  This allowed them to fight effectively as corsairs and pirates, and even to fight frigates in coastal waters.  Felucca Xebecs were most common and used lateen sails."

 ship_galley_T36_indian_qatiraDESCR:1 "A coastal ship, the Katora or Qatira was a small oared double-ended Calcutta vessel curved at the back, using both sails and oars."
 ship_heavy_T34_western_two_decker:1 "Two-decker"
 ship_heavy_T34_western_two_deckerDESCR:1 "Two-deckers came in many shapes and sizes, but all were sailing warships that had two decks devoted to their cannons.  This doubled the effective firepower of the ship, which made it much deadlier in combat.  The larger two-deckers were known as Ships of the Line."
 ship_light_T40_western_frigate:1 "Frigate"
 ship_light_T40_western_frigateDESCR:1 "Eighteenth century frigates were warships that chose to sacrifice armament for speed, allowing them to be used for patrolling and escort duties.  Each carried a complement of 28 or more guns on a single deck, unlike ships of the line, which used two or more decks to carry multiple batteries of guns."

 ship_transport_T40_western_east_indiaman:1 "East Indiaman"
 ship_transport_T40_western_east_indiamanDESCR:1 "As European nations established trading companies in the Far East, they needed ships that could travel around the world.  Indiamen were large vessels built to carry cargo, not to sail quickly.  They carried both passengers and goods and were capable of defending themselves against pirates."

 ship_transport_T40_muslim_armed_merchant_dhowDESCR:1 "A large merchant dhow outfitted for war."
 ship_heavy_T44_western_three_decker:1 "Three-decker"
 ship_heavy_T44_western_three_deckerDESCR:1 "A sailing warship that maintained three decks of guns on each side.  Three-deckers replaced earlier two-deckers for obvious reasons, relegating those ships to be third-, fourth- or even fifth-raters while the three-deckers took on the role of Ships of the Line."
 ship_galley_T45_muslim_three_masted_xebec:1 "Xebec-Frigates"
 galley_ship_three_masted_xebecDESCR:1 "Later Xebecs were built larger to compete with sailed warships.  With three masts flying square sails, they were able to carry a larger complement of guns and crew, breathing new life into galleys in war."
 ship_light_T48_western_heavy_frigate:1 "Heavy Frigate"
 western_light_ship_heavy_frigateDESCR:1 "With the naval arms race, 28-gun frigates were replaced with larger 40-gun heavy frigates that could fight more effectively in combat.  Some navies even produced 44-gun 'super frigates', but most maintained a strict division between frigates and ships of the line."
 ship_light_T53_western_steam_frigate:1 "Steam Frigate"
 western_light_ship_steam_frigateDESCR:1 "A warship powered by steam, steam frigates began as paddlewheels but soon changed to use screws for propulsion.  Coal shortages and a lack of coaling stations required the frigates to maintain traditional sails as well, but their screws allowed them to steam ahead in conditions where ordinary ships would flounder."
 ship_transport_T54_western_clipper:1 "Clipper"
 western_transport_ship_clipperDESCR:1 "A fast, yacht-like vessel with three masts and a square rig.  They were narrow and could carry only limited cargo but their large sails allowed them to 'clip' over the waves rather than plough through them.  They gained a reputation for being the fastest ships in the world and were used by smugglers to run blockades."
 ship_heavy_T55_western_steam_battleship:1 "Steam Battleship"
 western_heavy_ship_steam_battleshipDESCR:1 "Steam-powered battleships became possible once the screw replaced the paddle wheel.  This allowed them to carry decks of cannons on their broadsides.  Proving themselves in the Crimean War, Steam Battleships began to replace earlier sailing ships except for long-distance travel in which coaling stations were necessary for steam."
 ship_light_T57_western_armored_frigate:1 "Armoured Frigate"
 western_light_ship_armored_frigateDESCR:1 "Coal-powered screws supplemented by sails allowed the navy to add iron armour to frigates.  This additional weight meant that the number of guns had to be reduced back to a single deck, but the armoured frigate was the most powerful type of ship afloat in its day."
 ship_galley_T45_western_archipelago_frigate:1 "Archipelago Frigate"
 ship_galley_T45_archipelago_frigateDESCR:1 "Galleys were mostly limited to inland seas such as the Mediterranean.  By the eighteenth century, however, some were being used in a new role: as a kind of coast guard.  With small drafts and oars as well as sails, Archipelago Frigates were able to traverse the treacherous inshore waters along the coast.  They carried a large complement of guns and were also used to board enemy vessels."
 ship_galley_T15_western_war_galley:1 "War Galley"
 ship_galley_T15_western_war_galleyDESCR:1 "With the increasing importance of gunpowder, galley ships began carrying complements of cannons, then began being designed with gun decks along their broadsides.  These war galleys were just as capable as earlier galleys, but now also had the ability to launch salvos of cannonballs at enemy vessels."
 sudanese_ton_tigi_light_cavalry:1 "Clan Cavalry"
 sudanese_ton_tigi_light_cavalryDESCR:1 "The horse was a recent introduction to the Sahel, edging out native ponies.  Bought from North Africa in exchange for slaves, only the nobility could afford the expensive imported horses - especially given the rate at which they died in the region.  Because of this, cavalry were seen as a privileged arm of the military.  Cavalrymen were divided into the thirteen clans of the empire, each led by a Ton-Tigi ('Quiver Bearer') noble who paid for the horses under his command.  They carried quivers of javelins which they threw at enemies, then fought hand-to-hand with sabres.  The Ton-Tigi themselves were often rich enough to wear imported chain hauberks, while the average cavalryman wore no armour."
 sudanese_tuareg_camelry:1 "Tuareg Camelry"
 sudanese_tuareg_camelryDESCR:1 "The Tuaregs of the Sahara were nomadic people who relied upon camels for their livelihoods.  This made them both skilled mounted warriors and also willing to serve settled nations as mercenaries.  They generally fought with spears and swords but wore no armour."
 sudanese_free_skirmisher_infantry:1 "Skirmishers"
 sudanese_free_skirmisher_infantryDESCR:1 "Freemen such as the Keli-Bono of Mali or Chewa of Ethiopia who brought their own weapons with them, often family heirlooms passed down from father to son.  This meant there was considerable variety between soldiers, who could be wielding swords, axes, spears, bows or javelins.  They wore no armour, but carried hide shields to protect themselves from the enemy.  They were often settled onto conquered lands and given fiefs to rule, which helped to establish royal authority. The soldiers married local women and their sons inherited their fiefs and position in the army."
 sudanese_archer_infantry:1 "Archers"
 sudanese_archer_infantryDESCR:1 "The primary weapon of war was the bow, and most armies were made up primarily of archers.  African bows were small bows that had little power, so archers used simple wooden arrows without fletching or arrowheads that they fire-hardened and sometimes dipped in poison.  They would loose their arrows at the enemy, often two at a time, then retreat once their quivers had been emptied."
 sudanese_farima_heavy_cavalry:1 "Farima Braves"
 sudanese_farima_heavy_cavalryDESCR:1 "Increased contact with Muslim Arabs resulted in the spread of stirrups and saddles to the Sahel.  This allowed for a radical change in cavalry tactics: now they could be used to make a massed charge against infantry with long spears before continuing to fight with swords.  This devastating attack was difficult for infantry to defend against.  It also solidified the status of cavalry and helped to create a new caste of feudal knights who were rewarded for their service with special trousers and gold anklets.  Their fiefs provided them with enough income to maintain their horse and weapons.  It also resulted in an increased emphasis on Jonow - slaves captured in battle who were tasked with taking care of a horse and its master on campaign."
 sudanese_tribal_raider_light_cavalry:1 "Tribal Raiders"
 sudanese_tribal_raider_light_cavalryDESCR:1 "Imported horses from North Africa changed warfare by adding mobility.  Light horsemen such as the Galla in the East and the Mossi in the West could strike deep into the heart of powerful nations, capturing slaves and supply trains.  In battle, the unarmoured cavalry preferred to throw javelins from range rather than close combat with their spears and shields.  The raiders would hover around the battlefield, waiting for the infantry to break through so that they could attack fleeing infantry.  If their own side failed, the cavalry often left them to their fate."
 sudanese_formation_infantry:1 "Formation Infantry"
 sudanese_formation_infantryDESCR:1 "Faced with cavalry capable of massed charges, infantry armies had to adapt or perish.  Some began to drill soldiers so that they could tighten up into formation when cavalry neared, using spearmen in front to fend off the horsemen.  After the danger passed, they would spread out again to fight in traditional warrior style with bows."
 sudanese_sword_infantry:1 "Swordsmen"
 sudanese_sword_infantryDESCR:1 "Medieval African weapons were often lighter than European ones, with fire-hardened wood instead of iron.  As trade with North Africa increased, iron became more common and African blacksmiths began using it for arrowheads, spearheads and swords.  The swords especially breathed new life into infantry, allowing them to charge into enemy lines and chop down unarmoured bowmen."
 sudanese_quilted_heavy_cavalry:1 "Quilted Cavalry"
 sudanese_quilted_heavy_cavalryDESCR:1 "With imported Arab horses, new tactics of massed charges and close combat by cavalry were game-changers, but they also exposed cavalrymen to counterattack.  As their power grew, feudal nobility went to great lengths to protect themselves.  Their mounts were given lifidi (quilted armour) which could soften sword blows.  The knights themselves wore imported chain mail and iron helmets if they could afford it.  Cavalry continued to carry and use javelins, throwing them at the enemy faster than an enemy could fire a musket.  However, their main weapon now was a devastating charge with iron lances, which they made as soon as the infantry archers had exposed a weakness in the enemy lines."
 sudanese_war_raider_light_cavalry:1 "War Raiders"
 sudanese_war_raider_light_cavalryDESCR:1 "As their enemies began using cavalry, tribal raiders such as the Mossi were increasingly forced into close combat.  Unable to afford heavy armour, they adapted by wearing several layers of clothing with fetish charms sewn in to them, and began carrying lances which they dipped in poison before battle.  They also carried spears and arrows with iron tips.  The horses themselves wore leather and sometimes had a copper plate over their head.  The result was a deadly but light combination that was more than a match for most enemies, but still allowed them to raid behind enemy lines."
 sudanese_ranked_infantry:1 "Ranked Infantry"
 sudanese_ranked_infantryDESCR:1 "By the sixteenth century infantry armies were becoming standardised.  The front rank was spearmen who could close ranks to withstand a cavalry charge or throw their spears against enemy infantry.  The next three ranks were archers who launched volleys at the enemy until their arrows ran out, and the fifth rank were swordsmen who charged at the enemy after the arrows and javelins ran out.  It was this final stage of battle that was usually decisive."
 sudanese_sofa_infantry:1 "Sofa Slave Soldiers"
 sudanese_sofa_infantryDESCR:1 "Cavalry allowed armies to capture slaves, and so slaves began serving cavalry in battle.  Eventually, the Sofa (slave soldiers) acted as auxiliaries, charging at the enemy to create a weakness that the cavalry could exploit.  This combination was so successful for the Savannah states that even countries that had no cavalry of their own began adopting slave soldiers - and taking advantage of the opportunity to centralise power by maintaining a royal army of sofas that served as a counterweight to feudal armies."
 sudanese_heavy_infantry:1 "Heavy Infantry"
 sudanese_heavy_infantryDESCR:1 "Levied free troops were poorly trained.  A small professional heavy infantry helped to form the backbone of the army during times of war.  They fought using spears and shields made from stretched elephant hide, giving cover for the levied archers. They were distinguished by wearing gold bracelets and by their vow never to flee from combat.  In battle, they would tie the legs of archers together so they could not flee, then stand their ground until victorious or slain."
 sudanese_pony_archer_cavalry:1 "Pony Archers"
 sudanese_pony_archer_cavalryDESCR:1 "Cavalry in the Sahel was increasingly divided into two types: heavily armoured feudal nobles who rode imported Arab horses and lightly armoured tribal archers who rode native ponies.  Ponies were inexpensive to maintain, allowing nations to maintain levies of free riders, and so distance themselves from the decentralisation caused by feudalism.  The archers kept their distance from the enemy, acting as support for the infantry."
 sudanese_armored_heavy_cavalry:1 "Mailed Cavalry"
 sudanese_armored_heavy_cavalryDESCR:1 "Cavalry in the Sahel was increasingly divided into two types: heavily armoured feudal nobles who rode imported Arab horses and lightly armoured tribal archers who rode native ponies.  Heavy cavalry demanded an immense amount of money, since the horses were not only imported, they also tended to die quickly from the tsetse flies.  In addition, the chain mail and iron weapons that warriors needed were also imported, raising the cost of each knight to several slaves.  This meant that the cavalry increasingly demanded large fiefs of land in order to maintain themselves at fighting strength.  The effect was worth it, though: armoured knights could win a battle by themselves with a single massed charge."
 sudanese_sofa_musketeer_infantry:1 "Sofa Musketeers"
 sudanese_sofa_musketeer_infantryDESCR:1 "Firearms, like horses, were imported from overseas at great expense.  Increasingly this meant that armies of freemen were unable to afford them, and untrained in their use.  A ruler, on the other hand, could afford to stockpile thousands of muskets - and the slave soldiers, or Sofa, to use them.  This increased the power of rulers and helped them win wars that would result in capturing slaves, which in turn resulted in even more guns.  Sofa Musketeers still made up only a small portion of the army, but they could be devastating when they launched a salvo at the enemy."
 sudanese_elite_archer_infantry:1 "Elite Archers"
 sudanese_elite_archer_infantryDESCR:1 "As a warrior caste emerged, even infantry soldiers took pride in their profession.  They formed warrior societies and took vows never to surrender or retreat from battle.  Fighting with traditional African small bows, they would prepare for battle by tying their leg to their neighbour's leg, preventing them both from running.  They relied on the cavalry to ensure that enemies did not reach melee range.  If the cavalry failed, however, the elites fought to the very end."
 sudanese_angola_gun_infantry:1 "Gunpowder Infantry"
 sudanese_angola_gun_infantryDESCR:1 "Contact with Europeans brought about a new dynamic to the region.  West African states purchased 'Angola guns' - usually flintlock muskets in return for slaves.  The guns themselves were second-rate, with over half exploding on first use, but the flash and bang was impressive nonetheless.  Many African rulers began outfitting elite units with muskets, although the majority of the troops continued to use the more dependable traditional spears (assegais), swords, throwing clubs and bows.  The guns themselves were often fired overhead, used to scare enemy horses and reinforce war cries rather than inflict casualties.  Far more often used in battle were European crossbows, which were adopted rapidly by archers when they were available."
 sudanese_eso_heavy_cavalry:1 "Slave Cavalry"
 sudanese_eso_heavy_cavalryDESCR:1 "In order to ensure a strong cavalry, the Oyo established a permanent group of cavalry officers who were appointed for their skill rather than their rank - the Eso.  Each Eso was given command of a number of slaves and was required to maintain an army of Bada knights and supporting light cavalry archers.  They fought with lances, swords and bows.  To provide motivation, the commander of a failed expedition was executed."
 sudanese_spear_and_shot_infantry:1 "Spear and Shot Infantry"
 sudanese_spear_and_shot_infantryDESCR:1 "Although firearms were more common by the eighteenth century, they remained low quality and gunpowder was always scarce.  Many African nations fielded armies that were made up of specialised musketeers, spearmen and archers, making up for each other's weaknesses in battle.  In this respect, it resembled the Pike and Shot formations of early modern Europe.  When faced with enemy cavalry, they would dig ditches and make bush walls in the jungle."
 sudanese_musketeer_infantry:1 "Musketeers"
 sudanese_musketeer_infantryDESCR:1 "As the number of firearms grew, some nations began fielding entire regiments of musketeers in an attempt to copy the success of European and Arab armies.  This was especially true of small coastal states that could monopolise trade, but also lacked large armies to outfit.  Musketeer regiments were armed with flintlock muskets and sabres, which they used mostly to cut the heads off wounded enemies.  While they could be effective armies, they suffered from the same unreliable and inaccurate guns that had always plagued the continent, and relied on their supply trains for gunpowder."
 sudanese_gold_coast_infantry:1 "Gold Coast Mercenaries"
 sudanese_gold_coast_infantryDESCR:1 "Slave raids and the expansion of gunpowder empires in the Sahel resulted in many refugees and bandits.  Many ended up in the Gold Coast, where, lacking a nation of their own, they formed professional companies of soldiers for hire.  These Gold Coast Mercenaries served both African and European empires, and proved extremely effective against the mass levies of traditional African kingdoms in the region."
 sudanese_dragoon_cavalry:1 "Dragoons"
 sudanese_dragoon_cavalryDESCR:1 "As firearms became more common, cavalry increasingly lost their effectiveness against infantry.  Instead of cavalry charges, they were used as mounts for slow-moving musketeers.  They could race to a key position on the battlefield, then dismount, set up their guns and fire.  This not only breathed new life into the horses, it also made the musketeers much more useful."
 sudanese_slave_javelin_cavalry:1 "Javelineers"
 sudanese_slave_javelin_cavalryDESCR:1 "In an effort to centralise the state, some rulers maintained a monopoly on horses in their nations, establishing armies of slave soldiers who rode as heavy cavalry.  They were provided with quilted armour, both for themselves and their precious horses, and fought with axes and swords.  Their primary weapon, however, was the javelin: carrying two quivers on their backs, a cavalryman could launch them at the enemy faster than a musketeer could fire, then charge at their front line."
 sudanese_carabiner_cavalry:1 "Carabiners"
 sudanese_carabiner_cavalryDESCR:1 "As firearms became more common, cavalry increasingly lost their effectiveness against infantry.  In an attempt to counteract this, cavalrymen were given short muskets that could be fired from horseback.  These carbines gave the troops their name."
 sudanese_countermarch_musketeer_infantry:1 "Countermarch Musketeers"
 sudanese_countermarch_musketeer_infantryDESCR:1 "Smaller countries with access to guns made the most of their advantage by drilling musketeer troops in European Countermarch style.  Musketeers formed six ranks.  The front rank fired, then moved to the back to reload while the next rank took their turn, and in so doing allowed the regiment to be firing at the enemy constantly. This required a great deal of training to be able to work together, but it meant the musket could finally take centre stage on the battlefield."
 sudanese_savannah_musketeer_infantry:1 "Musketeers"
 sudanese_savannah_musketeer_infantryDESCR:1 "Firearms took longer to reach the interior of the continent, in part because cavalry was so dominant on the Savannah and in part because the coastal nations intentionally blocked access to gunpowder to their rivals.  As the nineteenth century began, it became clear that cavalry could not stand up to modern firearms, and even in the Savannah musketeer armies began to dominate."
 sudanese_sofa_rifle_infantry:1 "Sofa Riflemen"
 sudanese_sofa_rifle_infantryDESCR:1 "Most slave traders offered outdated flintlock muskets to African nations, often by law.  Canny African states could play off one European power against another in the hopes of gaining better weaponry - even modern rifles.  A rich ruler might be able to secure several thousand rifled muskets and outfit regiments of slave soldiers with them.  The rifles had the advantage of being accurate even at long ranges, although they were still slow to reload."
 sudanese_rifled_infantry:1 "Rifled Musketeers"
 sudanese_rifled_infantryDESCR:1 "Smooth-bore firearms like the musket were notoriously inaccurate, often off by more than a foot at fifty yards.  This meant that musketeers had to fight in tight groups that were vulnerable to increasingly deadly artillery fire. The solution was to introduce rifled muskets that added spin to a bullet and made it fly straight, making these 'rifles' much more accurate and deadly at ranges where a regular musket would be completely ineffective. The downside was that reloading such a gun was time-consuming - a rifle could get off only one shot for every three musket balls - so riflemen were trained to fight in pairs, one shooting while the other reloaded. Although rifles had been put into use by the late eighteenth century, their cost and disadvantages made them relatively rare until much later.  Riflemen such as the Prussian Jaegers, French Voltigeurs or British Greenjackets made excellent sharpshooters and snipers, but because they fought in smaller groups were unable to protect themselves from cavalry.  Most armies maintained small numbers of riflemen in each brigade to compensate for each other's weaknesses."
 sudanese_columnar_infantry:1 "Columnar Infantry"
 sudanese_columnar_infantryDESCR:1 "Revolutionary France relied on conscript soldiers for the bulk of their army. To give these green troops confidence in battle they placed them in a single column that marched steadily forward towards the enemy to the beat of hundreds of drums. The column presented a thin target that could turn to form a line or dig in to entrenchments that protected them from enemy attack.  The men in front would be killed by enemy fire, but eventually the men would climb over the bodies of their own dead and break through enemy lines.  Although losses could be high, columns often won against other formations through sheer stubbornness and force of numbers."
 sudanese_impulse_infantry:1 "Impulse Infantry"
 sudanese_impulse_infantryDESCR:1 "Impulse Infantry relied upon a 'cloud' of light infantry that acted as sharpshooters and skirmishers, keeping the enemy pinned down under fire while the main line advanced into position to charge the enemy line and deliver a coup de grace."
 sudanese_lancer_cavalry:1 "Lancers"
 sudanese_lancer_cavalryDESCR:1 "The creme de la creme of the Napoleonic army. Although their lances made them less agile these cavalry troops were formidable adversaries when charging their enemies directly."
 sudanese_breech_infantry:1 "Breech Loaded Riflemen"
 sudanese_breech_infantryDESCR:1 "Nearly all early firearms were muzzle-loaded, or loaded from the front. This made even the more advanced guns slow to reload, a critical factor in battle. The first mass-produced breech-loader (back-loaded guns) began appearing in the nineteenth century and made combat much deadlier. Where before a well-trained soldier could fire as many as four shots a minute, even a poorly trained soldier could fire faster with a breech-loaded rifle.  This had the effect of making a single soldier much deadlier than ever before."
 sudanese_jominian_infantry:1 "Jominian Infantry"
 sudanese_jominian_infantryDESCR:1 "As armies grew in the years following the Napoleonic Wars, so too did the need to properly deploy these armies.  One leading military thinker, Antoine-Henri Jomini, placed heavy emphasis on the concentration of troops with 'interior lines' from which it would be easy to mass power on specific points in the enemy's lines.  In practise, this led to mass charges in order to overwhelm enemy defences.  While this did have the downside of removing emphasis from firepower, many nations were distrustful of a faster rate of fire, fearing troops would expend their ammunition too quickly and flee. These tactics formed the basis of the French, Russian, Austrian, and American military schools well into the nineteenth century."
 sudanese_hunter_cavalry:1 "Hunter Cavalry"
 sudanese_hunter_cavalryDESCR:1 "Hunter cavalry were lightly armoured units trained for rapid action.  They specialised in skirmishes and were renowned for their shooting skills.  They proved so useful during the shifting lines of battle that the French army developed these 'Chasseur à Cheval' into a significant part of their cavalry."
 sudanese_uhlan_cavalry:1 "Uhlans"
 sudanese_uhlan_cavalryDESCR:1 "The first Uhlans were created in the early eighteenth century. They were used primarily for reconnaissance for the more heavily armoured cavalry, as well as being assigned to skirmishes. Later on they became an essential part of the military structure due to their light armour, making them fast and agile on the battlefield, and for their high shock value against their enemies.  Uhlan cavalry were a good alternative to large infantry armies as they were not only heavy hitting but also more cost effective. This allowed smaller nations with less manpower to actually put up an effective fight, as armies on foot were also slower compared to their mounted counterparts."
 sudanese_lighthussar_cavalry:1 "Light Hussars"
 sudanese_lighthussar_cavalryDESCR:1 "As Cavalry became more specialised, the Hussar started to evolve. The Hussar unit became less like the heavy Polish Hussar and more like the light Hungarian original. The ability of these light and mobile troops to find the enemy, harass them, and overrun their artillery more than made up for their lack of armour."
 sudanese_drill_infantry:1 "Drill Infantry"
 sudanese_drill_infantryDESCR:1 "Able to fight at close range or from further away, musketeers were versatile indeed - but only if they could react quickly to the shifting battlefield. Frederick of Prussia trained his men rigorously to deal with any situation that could conceivably come up until they became an incredible fighting force that never broke ranks and could fire as much as one shot every fifteen seconds under combat conditions!  This Prussian Drill infantry became the model army for the rest of the world after its stunning successes in battle and was used by both sides in the American Revolution."
 sudanese_mass_infantry:1 "Mass Infantry"
 sudanese_mass_infantryDESCR:1 "A favourite of the Russians, highly drilled Mass Infantry could be relied on to charge while under fire without breaking, resulting in terrible casualties for the enemy if it succeeded in reaching enemy lines. The bayonet and constant drill brought back the charge tactic in force: mass infantry launched a devastating volley of fire at their enemy, then set their bayonets and charged.  The result could be deadly to their enemies when it succeeded - or deadly to their own side if it failed."
 polynesian_skirmish_infantry:1 "Skirmishers"
 polynesian_skirmish_infantryDESCR:1 "Tribal warriors who fought primarily with wooden javelins, throwing clubs and cloth slings.  They wore no armour, but oiled their skin to make it difficult to catch hold of them, and nobles wore feathered capes that provided some protection.  They usually fought in small war bands such as the Maori Taua that travelled by war canoe to rival islands.  They preferred to fight from ambush."
 polynesian_pike_infantry:1 "Pikemen"
 polynesian_pike_infantryDESCR:1 "As populations grew, long spears became the primary weapon of war.  At the beginning of a battle, skirmishers would launch a hail of javelins and stones at the enemy.  Then the spearmen who made up most of the army would stand in close formation in a crescent shape, presenting a wall of points at the enemy.  Just like the Greek Phalanx, this formation resulted in few deaths until one side broke and ran."
 polynesian_elite_infantry:1 "Elite Warriors"
 polynesian_elite_infantryDESCR:1 "When two phalanxes met, the side that broke first was the one that suffered heavy casualties.  To encourage the enemy to break first, nobles formed warrior societies and fought as heavy infantry, trying to get in close to the enemy spearmen.  Sometimes a battle was decided through ritual battle between two champions rather than risk heavy casualties.  The Koa of Hawai'i carried swords and clubs studded with shark teeth, wore gourds as helmets and practised a secret martial art known as Lua.  The Tama'tau of Tonga accepted only the bravest veterans and tattooed themselves all over their bodies to frighten enemies."

Tribes that were able to purchase muskets from Europeans found that they had an advantage over their neighbours - although the slow-firing guns were no guarantee of victory.  Nevertheless, Maori and Hawaiian kings managed to disrupt the balance of power and form empires using the new weapons."

 polynesian_platoon_infantryDESCR:1 "Bayonets were introduced in the mid-seventeenth century and were gradually refined and made more reliable.  Throughout the seventeenth century tactics remained the same: musketeers advanced slowly on the enemy, pausing to fire volleys at them in an attempt to break the enemy line, allowing cavalry to pursue and mop up the scattered enemy.  When this failed, a bayonet charge and hand-to-hand combat was necessary.  This tactic gradually made pikemen superfluous on the battlefield, and where there had been three pikemen to every musketeer by the beginning of the century, there were five musketeers to every pikemen by its end.  Scottish Highlanders were known for being willing to charge the enemy just as much as shoot at them."

 polynesian_carabinier_cavalryDESCR:1 "The Carabiniers first came into being in the late sixteenth century and were a type of heavy cavalry that had many things in common with Cuirassiers. They also wore protective armour, though slightly less than a Cuirassier. The main difference between the two cavalry forces was their armament. A Carabinier's main weapon was the carbine, a short wheellock handgun. In addition to the carbine, they were also armed with a sword."

The most popular and arguably most effective tactic was to form a thin line facing the enemy so that musketeers could inflict maximum casualties on the enemy and react quickly to enemy movement. This also allowed for specialised soldiers to appear along the line such as the grenadier, while regular musketeers earned the name fusiliers after their flintlocks."

 polynesian_skirmisher_infantryDESCR:1 "Standing armies were small, and even in the seventeenth century levies were called upon during wartime to make up the bulk of the army. These conscript troops did not have the training or discipline of regulars and were often distrusted by their commanders. With more accurate and faster guns making pike screens unnecessary, some commanders began using these men as irregular infantry who operated as marksmen and skirmishers in small units around the main army. These irregular skirmishers could help scout unfamiliar terrain, pin down enemy units until the main force could arrive, and best of all, were expendable.  Austria in particular made great use of their 'Grenzers', who made up over a quarter of the Austrian army."

The result could be deadly to their enemies when it succeeded - or deadly to their own side if it failed."
 polynesian_rifled_infantry:1 "Rifled Musketeers"
 polynesian_rifled_infantryDESCR:1 "Smooth-bore firearms like the musket were notoriously inaccurate, often off by more than a foot at fifty yards.  This meant that musketeers had to fight in tight groups that were vulnerable to increasingly deadly artillery fire. The solution was to introduce rifled muskets that added spin to a bullet and made it fly straight, making these 'rifles' much more accurate and deadly at ranges where a regular musket would be completely ineffective. The downside was that reloading such a gun was time-consuming - a rifle could get off only one shot for every three musket balls - so riflemen were trained to fight in pairs, one shooting while the other reloaded. Although rifles had been put into use by the late eighteenth century, their cost and disadvantages made them relatively rare until much later.  Riflemen such as the Prussian Jaegers, French Voltigeurs or British Greenjackets made excellent sharpshooters and snipers, but because they fought in smaller groups were unable to protect themselves from cavalry.  Most armies maintained small numbers of riflemen in each brigade to compensate for each other's weaknesses."

The column presented a thin target that could turn to form a line or dig in to entrenchments that protected them from enemy attack.  The men in front would be killed by enemy fire, but eventually the men would climb over the bodies of their own dead and break through enemy lines.

 polynesian_breech_infantry:1 "Breech Loaded Riflemen"
 polynesian_breech_infantryDESCR:1 "Nearly all early firearms were muzzle-loaded, or loaded from the front. This made even the more advanced guns slow to reload, a critical factor in battle. The first mass-produced breech-loader (back-loaded guns) began appearing in the nineteenth century and made combat much deadlier. Where before a well-trained soldier could fire as many as four shots a minute, even a poorly trained soldier could fire faster with a breech-loaded rifle.  This had the effect of making a single soldier much deadlier than ever before."

 polynesian_jominian_infantryDESCR:1 "As armies grew in the years following the Napoleonic Wars, so too did the need to properly deploy these armies.  One leading military thinker, Antoine-Henri Jomini, placed heavy emphasis on the concentration of troops with 'interior lines' from which it would be easy to mass power on specific points in the enemy's lines.  In practise, this led to mass charges in order to overwhelm enemy defences.  While this did have the downside of removing emphasis from firepower, many nations were distrustful of a faster rate of fire, fearing troops would expend their ammunition too quickly and flee. These tactics formed the basis of the French, Russian, Austrian, and American military schools well into the nineteenth century."

The Ironclad Battleship abandoned sails altogether, allowing it to place turrets on the deck without fear they would get caught in the rigging.  This allowed them to carry heavy guns that could turn to face an enemy, effectively increasing its firepower."

Plank-built vessels had greater carrying capacity and were faster than previous ships.  The plank built boats eventually evolved into large sea craft propelled by sails and oars which could traverse ocean waters. The Chontal longship was about the size of a Viking longship and was used for trade with the people of the Caribbean and Florida."
 indonesian_simbalan_infantry:1 "Simbalan Warriors"
 indonesian_simbalan_infantryDESCR:1 "Traditional Indonesian warriors fought with a variety of weapons.  They carried bamboo spears with fire-hardened tips known as Simbalan which they hurled at the enemy.  Most warriors would avoid hand-to-hand combat, allowing the headmen to fight each other to decide a battle or launching ambushes at dawn to surprise opponents.  When forced into melee combat, they used wavy-edged swords and knives known as Krises which could leave savage wounds on an unarmoured opponent."
 indonesian_stockade_infantry:1 "Stockade Warriors"
 indonesian_stockade_infantryDESCR:1 "Indonesian warriors preferred to avoid open combat.  When an attack was imminent, many units build themselves makeshift stockades known as Kubu.  Relying on the ubiquitous palm trees of the region, they made walls and covered the holes with earth, leaving one side open to the jungle or to a mountain to allow them to escape.  This slowed down their enemy and allowed them to loose arrows and spears from safety."
 indonesian_armored_infantry:1 "Armoured Headmen"
 indonesian_armored_infantryDESCR:1 "Trade with India and Europe allowed wealthy headmen to purchase iron chainmail from overseas, providing them with considerable protection against the spears and swords of their enemies.

 indonesian_lantaka_infantryDESCR:1 "Trade with China brought with it guns, and Indonesians adopted them enthusiastically.  Lantaka were hand-cannons made out of bamboo, filled with gunpowder or kerosene and then fired from a cart, boat or stockade.  However, the Lantaka were unable to swivel much, and so had limited use on the battlefield.  Where they were most useful were on ships or stockades - which made stockades even bigger threats."
 indonesian_arquebusier_infantry:1 "Foreign Arquebusiers"
 indonesian_arquebusier_infantryDESCR:1 "Trade with Arabia and Europe allowed foreign mercenaries and expeditionary forces to serve in Indonesia.  Some of these foreign troops wore iron chain mail and carried matchlock arquebuses.  Unfortunately, the humid conditions in the region made it hard to light the matches, so arquebusiers were trained to fight with swords more often than not.  Nevertheless, they made for a powerful vanguard that could inspire the rest of the army."
 indonesian_matchlockmen_infantry:1 "Native Matchlockmen"
 indonesian_matchlockmen_infantryDESCR:1 "By the seventeenth century some Indonesian smiths had learned how to make guns.  This allowed native rulers to field armies in which as many as 1 in 10 men were armed with muskets.  These matchlockmen attempted to pick off enemy commanders, which could cause the entire enemy army to flee in disarray if successful.  While the guns could be deadly, they had to overcome many challenges: the humidity made it hard to light the matches, local gunpowder was improperly corned and so was unreliable, and the cost of supplying troops with guns and gunpowder was high.  Realising these problems, musketeers tended to fire a single salvo at the enemy before switching to swords and krises."
 indonesian_native_musketeer_infantry:1 "Native Musketeers"
 indonesian_native_musketeer_infantryDESCR:1 "By the early eighteenth century Indonesian guns were becoming more sophisticated.  Guns were finely crafted heirlooms that were straight and finely inlaid.  Knowing they were unreliable, soldiers had learned to attach swords or daggers to their guns, allowing them to charge the enemy after firing a single salvo without changing weapons."
 indonesian_carabao_guard_infantry:1 "Carabao Guards"
 indonesian_carabao_guard_infantryDESCR:1 "With unreliable gunpowder weapons, elite soldiers such as royal bodyguard adopted both guns and swords.  These versatile warriors wore coats of mail fashioned of plates of Carabao horn and brass wire.  This armour was very effective against the swords they carried for close range combat, but were useless against enemy guns.  For those, they carried flintlock muskets which could be fired even in humid conditions and were supplied with two rounds of ammunition each.  These elites made up the backbone of the army, which mostly consisted of unarmoured men carrying bows, pikes and swords."

Although they wore no armour, they carried large shields that covered their entire body, leading their Portuguese enemies to call them 'Adargueiros'.  This gave them considerable protection against enemy spears and arrows, allowing them to charge enemy units.  In this way, battles were usually decided by the clash of heavy infantry, even though they represented less than one in ten soldiers.

Rather than have each tribe fight as their own Impi, he reorganised them into impis by age (the Age Grade system).  This not only reduced the likelihood of an Impi retreating back to its home, it also made the 'Buffalo Horns' tactic viable: veterans were placed in the centre of the army (the 'Chest') to press the enemy while younger, less experienced troops attempted to outflank the enemy in the 'horns' and older veterans were held in reserve in the 'loins' to exploit vulnerabilities."

When the Bantu leader Shaka took power, he introduced brutal discipline to the army, executing men who disobeyed or were unable to meet his exacting standards.  Soon, his troops were capable of marching fifty miles per day and were drilled in the Chest and Horns tactic.  Shaka also standardised the infantry weapon as the heavy stabbing spear (ikwla) and hardwood cudgel (iwisa) while carrying heavy oxhide shields to protect themselves.

 indonesian_tumandar_cavalryDESCR:1 "The Tumandar were Muslims from military families who provided their own horses and were recruited as high-paid cavalry.  They fought in disciplined Mongol style, charging close to loose arrows at the enemy, then retreating again.  In many ways this style of warfare was unchanged since the days of Genghis Khan, but one innovation was their use of 'water-proof' composite bows, a requirement to avoid the bows falling apart in the humid tropics of Indonesia."
 indonesian_kshatriya_cavalry:1 "Kshatriya Cavalry"
 indonesian_kshatriya_cavalryDESCR:1 "Originally all cavalry were Persian Arabs, but eventually a professional native cavalry caste emerged in Indonesia.  These men were largely from the militant Kshatriya caste and were eager to fight as warriors.  They were allowed to train and fight under their own rajas as long as they fought for the empire loyally.  They wore quilted tunics with leather cushioned by silk, and wore battle-axes and daggers in their belts for close combat.  They valued bravery and fought primarily with javelins."
 indonesian_tabinan_cavalry:1 "Tabinan Cavalry"
 indonesian_tabinan_cavalryDESCR:1 "As cavalry became more common, regular cavalry armies were raised as part of feudal obligations.  A Mansabdar who owned a fief (jagir) would buy horses, often from Arabia or Persia, and hire men from his own caste and ethnicity to serve as cavalrymen.  Since the horses were so expensive, they were branded so that the men could not sell them.  The Tabinan (regular cavalrymen) spent hours every day training in swordsmanship, weight-lifting and riding, but fought as individuals rather than as a unit.  Their primary weapon was a fifteen-foot spear."
 indonesian_mansabdar_cavalry:1 "Mansabdar Cavalry"
 indonesian_mansabdar_cavalryDESCR:1 "As time went on, the Mansabdar system grew in popularity.  In response, the size of each fief was cut so that the cavalry units maintained by each mansabdar were smaller and more flexible.  This also decreased the effect of treachery or rebellion by a Mansabdar.  Even with this change, so many young noblemen applied to be Mansabdars that the army could not find posts for them all.  Instead, it created a new rank: Ahadi, or Gentleman Trooper.  The Ahadis served as messengers and elite bodyguards, hoping that their service would be rewarded by promotion to Mansabdar."
 indonesian_silhedar_cavalry:1 "Silhedar Cavalry"
 indonesian_silhedar_cavalryDESCR:1 "It was expensive to import horses, so a man who owned his own horse - a Silhedar, or Equipment Holder - could demand high wages.  As horses became more common on the subcontinent, Silhedars also became common.  Some formed condotteries and served as mercenaries - professional soldiers who fought for pay rather than loyalty to a liege.  Governments attempted to win their loyalty by awarding their leaders jagirs, hoping to entice them to become part of the existing feudal system, but the Silhedar cavalry themselves were always independent agents.  They fought much as their feudal comrades did, but were generally better armoured and armed.  At their height, they made up two-thirds of all cavalry."
 indonesian_bargir_cavalry:1 "Bargir Raiders"
 indonesian_bargir_cavalryDESCR:1 "In an attempt to eradicate the feudal system, the army began raising cavalry armies directly.  These 'Burden-takers' or Bargirs were paid less than Silhedars, but received their horses and weapons from the state.  Since they carried few supplies, the Bargirs were able to travel quickly and surprise the enemy.  However, they were lightly armoured and preferred to avoid open battle.  Instead, they attacked the countryside around an enemy army, seizing their supplies for themselves and weakening the enemy at the same time.  Soon they became famous for these harassing raids.  As they grew in number, they were placed in charge of the remaining Silhedars."
 indonesian_ekanda_cavalry:1 "Ekanda Cavalry"
 indonesian_ekanda_cavalryDESCR:1 "Volunteer cavalry who owned their own horses and so were highly paid for their service.  The Ekanda were armed with a wide variety of weapons including muskets, matchlocks, daggers, clubs, bows, spears, lances and swords.  They mostly fought with sword and shield, able to take a musket-ball from long range and a pistol-ball close up, but they would fire their muskets during bush-fighting before turning and retreating to the main force."
 indonesian_heavy_elephant_cavalry:1 "Heavy War Elephants"
 indonesian_heavy_elephant_cavalryDESCR:1 "Familiar with war elephants, Indonesian armies found their weaknesses, and in turn, found ways to protect them.  On their backs were large howdahs which contained three or four men with javelins and spears to attack from range.  They were trained in crushing people with their feet and piercing them with their tusks."
 indonesian_armored_elephant_cavalry:1 "Armoured Elephants"
 indonesian_armored_elephant_cavalryDESCR:1 "As firearms became deadlier on the battlefield, war elephants became targets for the enemy.  In reaction, war elephants wore iron cuirasses to protect them from bullets, although they still needed close-up protection.  This was provided by infantrymen whose job was to protect its flanks and by an even larger howdah which contained eight men per elephant, four on each side, armed with bows and muskets.  Finally, the elephants had knives attached to their tusks, giving them an additional edge in battle.  This once again placed them in the role of shock troops who could charge at enemy lines to devastating result."
 indonesian_carabinier_cavalry:1 "Carabiniers"
 indonesian_carabinier_cavalryDESCR:1 "The Carabiniers first came into being in the late sixteenth century and were a type of heavy cavalry that had many things in common with Cuirassiers. They also wore protective armour, though slightly less than a Cuirassier. The main difference between the two cavalry forces was their armament. A Carabinier's main weapon was the carbine, a short wheellock handgun. In addition to the carbine, they were also armed with a sword."
 indonesian_hunter_cavalry:1 "Hunter Cavalry"
 indonesian_hunter_cavalryDESCR:1 "Hunter cavalry were lightly armoured units trained for rapid action.  They specialised in skirmishes and were renowned for their shooting skills.  They proved so useful during the shifting lines of battle that the French army developed these 'Chasseur à Cheval' into a significant part of their cavalry."
 indonesian_lancer_cavalry:1 "Lancers"
 indonesian_lancer_cavalryDESCR:1 "The creme de la creme of the Napoleonic army. Although their lances made them less agile these cavalry troops were formidable adversaries when charging their enemies directly."
 western_wheeled_ribaudekin_artillery:1 "Wheeled Ribaudekins"
 western_wheeled_ribaudekin_artilleryDESCR:1 "First used in the battle of Crecy, the Ribaudekin was a cannon that shot large arrows and grapeshot at enemy troops.  The cannon was a rare sight on the battlefield until the 1380s, when it was mounted on wheels to provide it with limited mobility."
 western_bombard_artillery:1 "Bombards"
 western_bombard_artilleryDESCR:1 "A large muzzle-loaded bronze cannon which fired a stone ball at enemy fortifications.  Bombards date back to before the fourteenth century, but their size and weight limited them to defensive use only.  By the end of the fourteenth century, they were brought along on campaign for use in sieges, seeing considerable use in the Hundred Years War."
 western_houfnice_artillery:1 "Houfnices"
 western_houfnice_artilleryDESCR:1 "The Hussite Wars saw the introduction of short barreled 'houfnice' cannons, from where we get the later term 'howitzer'.  These smaller guns lacked the firepower of their larger cousins, but their mobility more than made up for it.  They were used to fire into crowds of infantry or to make horses shy away.  After the wars the design spread into the rest of Europe."
 western_pedrero_artillery:1 "Swivel Guns"
 western_pedrero_artilleryDESCR:1 "The expense of producing bombards combined with their immobility to make them a liability on the battlefield.  The success of the Hussite rebels showed rulers that small, mobile guns had a place on the battlefield.  The Pedrero (also called a Bercos, Perrier a Boite, or Murderer) filled that niche.  It was a small breech-loading swivel gun that was quick firing for its time and light enough that it could be pulled on a limber - a two-wheeled cart that could be towed by horses, introduced by the Venetians in the fifteenth century."
 western_culverin_artillery:1 "Culverins"
 western_culverin_artilleryDESCR:1 "By the end of the fifteenth century artillery guns had become a standard part of every European army.  Two technological changes helped to spur this: the widespread adoption of cast iron techniques and the development of corned gunpowder, which clumped the gunpowder and allowed pockets of air to form which helped it ignite consistently.  One trend was to have increasingly larger cannons which could fire heavier balls against the enemy from even farther away.  The Culverin was the largest cannon on the battlefield, and continued to be used for centuries."
 western_saker_artillery:1 "Sakers"
 western_saker_artilleryDESCR:1 "By the end of the fifteenth century artillery guns had become a standard part of every European army.  Two technological changes helped to spur this: the widespread adoption of cast iron techniques and the development of corned gunpowder, which clumped the gunpowder and allowed pockets of air to form which helped it ignite consistently.  One trend was to have a wide variety of gun sizes to be able to react to every situation appropriately.  The Saker played the role of a medium cannon, and for this reason was known as a 'Moyenne' in France.  Although used most often on ships, it was also used extensively on land."
 western_demiculverin_artillery:1 "Demi-Culverins"
 western_demiculverin_artilleryDESCR:1 "As artillery continued to become more specialised, many armies saw a need for cannons that were not as large as the massive Culverins, but were more powerful than the smaller Sakers.  The result was the Demi-Culverin, a medium cannon that was more accurate than the Culverin and more powerful than the Saker."
 western_flying_battery_artillery:1 "Flying Batteries"
 western_flying_battery_artilleryDESCR:1 "The biggest problem with artillery was how slowly it moved.  As an army pressed forward, artillery was often left behind.  The armies of Gustavus Adolphus attempted to solve this problem by making irregular horse artillery units in which cavalry soldiers attached their horses to artillery pieces.  This gave the artillery more mobility, but rendered the cavalry largely ineffective in combat.  AT the same time, the Swedish army also reduced the number of types of cannons to standardise their ammunition."
 western_leather_gun_artillery:1 "Leather Guns"
 western_leather_gun_artilleryDESCR:1 "As more nations began to see the advantage of mobile artillery, they looked into ways to increase the mobility.  One change was to attach Dragoons to the artillery, so that the infantry could defend the guns while the horses pulled the cannons.  Another change was to cast guns out of light copper instead of heavy iron, binding the cannon in leather.  This reduced the crew needed to two and allowed for very mobile cannons, but the copper cannons grew so overheated that they were unusable after only a few shots, and the weapon was largely abandoned after a few years."
 western_regimental_gun_artillery:1 "Regimental Guns"
 western_regimental_gun_artilleryDESCR:1 "While large cannons were effective in sieges, mobile artillery was needed for the battlefield.  A shortage of horses and iron led to the introduction of small Regimental Guns, which fired three-pound balls, could be reloaded faster than a musket and were light enough that they could be dragged by a unit of infantry rather than horses.  While their range was limited they more than made up for it with their increased use in battles."
 western_coehorn_mortar_artillery:1 "Coehorn Mortars"
 western_coehorn_mortar_artilleryDESCR:1 "Mortars are cannons that fire their shot high into the air in order to land on the enemy.  Although they were first used at the Siege of Constantinople, mortars were so large and heavy that they saw little use until Baron Menno van Coehoorn invented a mobile version at the Siege of Grave.  Since they fired upwards, they could be used even in broken and hilly terrain such as the Scottish Highlands, which gave them a permanent place in the British army."
 western_horse_artillery:1 "Horse Artillery"
 western_horse_artilleryDESCR:1 "Seeing the advantage of smaller field guns, the Russians began equipping cavalry formations with small units of horse artillery - two-pound cannons and three-pound mortars.  Although the guns were weak compared to their larger cousins, they were highly mobile and so could be brought to bear against the enemy quickly.  They were so effective in battle that Frederick the Great copied the idea and introduced the first Horse Artillery units to Western Europe."
 western_field_howitzer_artillery:1 "Field Howitzers"
 western_field_howitzer_artilleryDESCR:1 "Horse Artillery proved to be highly effective on the battlefield but still lacked the punch of larger guns.  To increase the mobility of guns, padded gun carriages were introduced which could be drawn by horses, set up and fired without lengthy preparation.  At the same time, French Engineers standardised cannon design so that the gun barrel, carriage assembly and ammunition was uniform across the army, allowing for easier repair and large-scale manufacture.  Field Howitzers, as these cannons became known, also used flintlock firing mechanisms which were more reliable and safer than the old method of igniting the powder in a touchhole.  The Howitzers were used by Napoleon to great effect by concentrating their fire against an enemy position."
 western_armstrong_gun_artillery:1 "Armstrong Guns"
 western_armstrong_gun_artilleryDESCR:1 "The Crimean War showed Europe that it needed to shake off the lessons of the Napoleonic Wars.  New artillery was developed which made use of technological advances.  Machinery was used to produce rifled barrels that dramatically increased accuracy.  The guns were breech-loaded and mounted on carriages so that it returned to firing position after recoiling, allowing for much faster reloading.  It was also engineered to allow it to heat and expand, allowing for more powerful explosions."
 asian_thousandball_artillery:1 "Thunder Cannons"
 asian_thousandball_artilleryDESCR:1 "The Thousand Ball Thunder Cannon (Qian Zi Lei Pao) was an early example of field gunpowder artillery, first used around 1300 AD.  It was a simple small bronze cannon on a wheeled wagon which could fire a hundred lead bullets at the enemy at short range."
 asian_eruptor_artillery:1 "Eruptor Cannons"
 asian_eruptor_artilleryDESCR:1 "Some of the first Chinese artillery were vase-shaped bombards known as Flying-Cloud Thunderclap Eruptors (Feiyun Pili Pao) or Huolongjing.  They were cast bronze cannons about four feet long.  Eruptors fired iron shells filled with gunpowder that burst on impact.  They were put to use during the fall of the Yuan Empire, where they were used to defend against Ming armies."
 asian_firearrow_artillery:1 "Fire Arrows"
 asian_firearrow_artilleryDESCR:1 "Called Shen Jijian in China, Chongtong in Korea and Bo Hiya in Japan, fire arrows were primitive rockets made of wood or bamboo and filled with black powder.  They could be lit with a long fuse and aimed at the enemy.  Later, the Mongols adopted the weapon and spread its use to the Middle East."
 asian_firewagon_artillery:1 "Fire Wagons"
 asian_firewagon_artilleryDESCR:1 "The Koreans developed the Hwacha fire wagon to act as a mobile platform to launch rockets known as Singijeons.  Each wagon carried as many as two hundred rockets, which could be launched as a salvo against an enemy, then moved to a new position as the lines changed.  The first Hwacha were built in the early fifteenth century, but later developments mid-century made them stronger and led to their mass production."
 asian_swivel_artillery:1 "Frankish Cannons"
 asian_swivel_artilleryDESCR:1 "After meeting Europeans in the sixteenth century, the Chinese were quick to study and copy their cannons.  Iron breech-loaded swivel guns used on board ship were of particular interest to the Chinese, who immediately reverse engineered them and began to mass produce their own versions.  The guns were given the name 'Folangji', meaning 'Frankish Machines', despite probably being of Portuguese origin.  They formed the backbone of Chinese artillery until well into the Qing dynasty, and were also commonly found in Japan where they were called Ozutsu."
 asian_general_artillery:1 "Invincible General Cannons"
 asian_general_artilleryDESCR:1 "By the beginning of the seventeenth century the breech-loading principle had been extended to large cannons, including the 'Invincible Great General' (Wu Di Da Jiang Jun), which could be loaded with 1,500 iron bullets and fired at enemy units.  When it could be used, it was deadly - but it had two large flaws that prevented it from being effective.  It was so massive that its recoil would destroy the cart used to transport it, so it had to be carefully dismounted in order to fire, making it all but immobile in combat.  It was also only effective at very short ranges (around two hundred feet)."
 asian_culverin_artillery:1 "Red Barbarian Cannons"
 asian_culverin_artilleryDESCR:1 "Chinese copies of the European guns and cannonballs was not quite the same quality, so increasingly the Chinese purchased them from Europe directly.  The Red-Haired Barbarian Cannon (Hongyi Pao) was the most common.  It was culverin, or large straight cannon, made out of copper or bronze - thus giving it a reddish colour which lent it the 'Red-Haired' part of its name, while the 'Barbarian' came from its origins - mostly from Holland, Portugal and England.  There were other variants, including the Spanish Lu Song Pao, which took its name from the port city of Luzon."
 asian_westernized_cannon:1 "Hundred Bullets Frankish Engines"
 asian_westernized_cannonDESCR:1 "Bai Zi Fo Lang Ji (Hundred Bullets Frankish Engines) was a Chinese gun based on European improvements.  A large cannon with a long, thick barrel, it was mounted on a special gun carriage that incorporated two metal hooks and an iron bucket filled with cotton to absorb recoil.  However, the carriage needed its wheels detached in order to fire the weapon.  These cannons were also known as Sinweipao (the Cannon Behind the Horse), since it could be moved around by horses during the battle."
 asian_flying_dragon_gun:1 "Flying Dragon Guns"
 asian_flying_dragon_gunDESCR:1 "An advanced design introduced by a German Jesuit priest, the Fei Long Chong (Flying Dragon Gun) was a heavy 26-pounder gun with an extremely long barrel that gave it a long range.  Although powerful and accurate, it was still hard to move and slow, and future Chinese guns would return to European styles."
