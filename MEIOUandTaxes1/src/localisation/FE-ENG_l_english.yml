 wor_disorder:1 "Disorder"
 wor_disorder_desc:1 "The Percy and Neville feud was a series of skirmishes, raids, and vandalism between two prominent northern English families, the House of Percy and the House of Neville, and their followers, that helped provoke the Wars of the Roses."
 bastard_feudalism:1 "Bastard Feudalism"
 bastard_feudalism_desc:1 "The so-called Wars of the Roses was the struggle between the Yorkist and Lancastrian descendants of Edward III for control of the throne and of local government. The origins of the conflict have been the subject of much debate. It can be seen as brought about as a result of Henry VI’s inadequacy and the opposition of his dynastic rival Richard, Duke of York, but local feuds between magnates added a further dimension. Because of the crown’s failure to control these disputes, they acquired national significance. Attempts have been made to link these civil conflicts to what is known as "bastard feudalism", the system that allowed magnates to retain men in their service by granting them fees and livery and made possible the recruiting of private armies.\n Yet this system can be seen as promoting stability in periods of strong rule as well as undermining weak rule such as that of Henry VI. Many nobles sought good government, rather than being factious, and were only forced into war by the king’s incompetence. The outbreak of civil war in England was indirectly linked to the failure in France, for Henry VI’s government had suffered a disastrous loss of prestige and, with it, authority."

 nobles_bribed_desc:1 "Despite the local nobilities having pledged for the opposite side of this civil war, they nevertheless are willing to switch to us if the price is right."
 attain_yorkist:1 "Attain Yorkist"
 attain_yorkist_desc:1 "In a bold and decisive move, the House of Lancaster has successfully subdued the Yorkist rebels who once threatened to overturn the rightful rule of Lancaster. Though the conflict was fueled by claims of legitimacy and bitter rivalry, the Lancastrians prevailed through sheer determination and strategic prowess.\nThese rebellious magnates, now brought into submission, are a testament to Lancaster's unwavering authority and resilience. With their influence diminished and control restored, the realm can breathe a tentative sigh of relief. However, the scars of this dynastic struggle linger, as tensions may rise again in the shadows of future conflicts."
 heir_legitimacy_questioned:1 "Heir Legitimacy Questioned"
 heir_legitimacy_questioned_desc:1 "In the volatile landscape of 15th-century England, where the crown was as often won through lineage as through arms, the legitimacy of birth was not merely a personal matter — it was a pillar upon which the entire monarchy stood. For Edward IV, the first Yorkist king to seize the throne during the Wars of the Roses, questions about his parentage posed a deeply destabilizing threat.\nWhen the future Edward IV, rose to power amidst the chaos of the Wars of the Roses, his enemies seized upon the rumors that had long swirled in hushed corners of court; that he had not been born of York blood, that during Richard’s absence in France, his mother, the duchess Cecily had consorted with another man — a common archer, some said, or a handsome courtier with ambitions of his own."
 ruler_legitimacy_questioned:1 "Ruler Legitimacy Questioned"
 ruler_legitimacy_questioned_desc:1 "Unlike his ancestors, who ruled with authority and martial prowess, [ROOT.Monarch.GetTitle] was mild-mannered, pious, and notoriously indecisive. He often failed to assert his will over the competing factions within the nobility, allowing personal rivalries and disputes to fester unchecked. This indecision not only weakened the authority of the crown but also emboldened ambitious nobles, such as Richard, Duke of York, to question [ROOT.Monarch.GetTitle]’s capability to rule.\nMoreover, [ROOT.Monarch.GetTitle]’s passivity in government affairs led to a breakdown in law and order. Peasants and townspeople grew increasingly disillusioned as the crown proved unable to curb local abuses or maintain stability. The crisis of royal authority was further aggravated by [ROOT.Monarch.GetTitle]’s periodic bouts of mental illness, during which governance was effectively paralyzed. At these times, the court descended into factional conflict, with rival noble houses vying for control of the kingdom."
