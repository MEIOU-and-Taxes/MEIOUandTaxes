 desc_Italian_bank_loans_Default:1 "Edward III’s excuse for his attack on France in 1337 was that Philip VI had appropriated the English king’s duchy of Aquitaine and the county of Ponthieu and was now threatening further attacks from across the channel. The French maintained their “auld alliance” with the Scots, who despite an agreement between his father and Robert the Bruce after the battle of Bannockburn. were still not helping matters by continuing to raid England across the borderlands and create mayhem in protest against any notion of deference to any English King.\nTo finance this endeavour Edward III chose to follow in the footsteps of his father and grandfather and to borrow money from the famous Banking families of Florence. In particular the Ricciardi of Lucca (1272-1294), the Frescobaldi of Florence (c.1294-1312) the Bardi family and above all in relation to this story, the Peruzzi family who were, until 1345, the rich patrons of Giotto di Bondone.  The Peruzzi and the Bardi families were the two that were most impacted by the English loan.\nThe Peruzzi family family lent Edward III 600,000 gold florins, whilst the Bardi family gambled even more bravely and lent him 900,000 florins.Failing in his quest to become hailed as the King of France Edward reneged on these payments and this led to the declaration of Bancarotta and the collapse of both Bardi & Peruzzi families’ banks in 1345 – with the consequence of a lot of negative vibes between the Florentines and future English requests for loans!"

Nevertheless, Arthur was known as the Connétable de Richemont.\nArthur fought against the English at an early age, was wounded and captured at the Battle of Azincourt in 1415, and therefore remained in England for the next five years. On the 10th October 1423 he married in Dijon Margaret of Burgundy, daughter of Duke Jean the Fearless, and was founded on 7. March 1425 appointed Connétable by King Charles VII. At the royal court in Bourges, Arthur was proteated by Yolande d'Aragon and became rivalry with Georges de La Trémoille. After Arthur's brother, Duke Jean, entered into an alliance with England in 1427, Arthur briefly fell into disgrace with the king.\nWith Jeanne d'Arc and Dunois at his side, Arthur commanded the French army in 1429 and defeated the English at Beaugency and Patay. After Trémoille was overthrown by intrigue in 1433, Arthur once again occupied a leading position at the court. In 1435, the Treaty of Arras was concluded through his mediation, in which King Charles VII recveded with the Duke of Burgundy. On the 13th In April 1436, Arthur solemnly found its way into liberated Paris and in the following years chased the English from Normandy and part of the Guyenne. He fended up with the attempt to recapture the Englishman in Normandy on 15 March. April 1450 in the Battle of Formigny. As a reward, he was awarded the dukedom of Touraine. Arthur rendered outstanding around the French army by reintroducing discipline and creating the Compagnies d'Ordonnance, from which today's French gendarmerie has developed."

He was captured by the Earl of Warwick in a skirmish at Savignies near Beauvais in 1431. In 1433 he was exchanged for John Talbot. Jean Poton fought numerous battles alongside Joan of Arc during the Loire Campaign and retained a lifelong support for her. With La Hire, he even tried, albeit in vain, to rescue Joan after she was captured. Believing Joan was being held captive in Compiègne, Jean Poton captured it, only to learn that the prisoner had already been moved to Rouen.\nIn the latter phase of the Hundred Years War he was active in the reconquest of Normandy and the conquest of Guyenne, often with Étienne de Vignolles, better known as La Hire, including the action at Gerbevoy.

During their joint campaigns, he contributed significantly to the lifting of the siege of Orléans before being promoted to Marshal of France on 17 July 1429, the day of the royal coronation of Charles VII in Reims.After the death of his grandfather Jean de Craon in 1432 and the disgrace of Georges de La Trémoille in 1433, Marshal de Rais gradually disengaged from the war. He was accused by his family, and in particular by his younger brother René de La Suze, of squandering his heritage by alienating his lands to the highest bidder in order to compensate for his lavish expenses, prodigalities which led to his prohibition by King Charles VII on 2 July 1435.\nAndré de Montfort-Laval or known as André de La Lohéac through his mother was the grandson of famous Breton Connétable of France Bertrand du Guesclin. On the 26th In September 1423, he served in the Battle of La Brossiniére in the French army against England, and at that time he already wore the sword as a symbol of the Breton support of France, which his maternal grandmother, Jeanne de Laval, the widow of the Connétable, had bequeathed to him. In 1428 André was taken prisoner by John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury, after the capitulation of Laval, which he was defending.

They arrived at La Rochelle in a Spanish fleet. At first Stewart's soldiers prove unpopular amongst the French, owing to their fondness for food and drink, but success in battle would make the Scottish army extremely welcome in France. Stewart and Gilbert Motier de La Fayette were commanders of the combined Franco-Scottish army at the battle of Baugé on 21 March 1421, where he won a great victory over the English, the first major setback suffered by the English armies during the Hundred Years War since the reign of Richard II. Buchan had been appointed by the Dauphin to defend Anjou against the Duke of Clarence, brother of King Henry V. Clarence was among the first to fall at the battle of Baugé, wounded by Sir John Swinton and dispatched by Sir Alexander Buchanon's battle axe.\nHowever, despite these welcome reinforcements, disaster would soon overtake Stewart and his Scottish army. On 17 August 1424 Buchan was killed at the Battle of Verneuil, along with most of the Scottish troops in France. Buchan and his generals unwisely chose to face the English army, led by John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedford in open battle. Bedford's army attacked aggressively from the south to take the Scots in the rear. Abandoned by their French allies and almost completely surrounded, the Scots made a ferocious last stand, but were overwhelmed. "

He eventually consented only after accepting that it was no longer compulsory to pass through Calais wool (the wool tax was the main income of the crown at the time). Tax revenues were reduced by 25% in 1369, due to the reminiscence of the Great Death in England. The English were unable to compete with taxes - up to 1,600,000 francs a year - which Charles V accepted in France to maintain permanent armies equipped for a siege war whose belligerents would not turn into Grandes Compagnies at the first truce. The English will be under constant pressure on all fronts for years. The English tried to counter the reversal of the situation achieved by Charles. Much of the territories they believed to control had rebelled and they had lost the tax revenues that their Guyenne possessions could have provided them. They plead before their Parliament to obtain the resources to counter-attack, but they cannot obtain the funding of garrisons for all the cities of Aquitaine, which they are no longer sure to hold.

In 1355 the Hundred Years' War reignited, and John the Good had to convene the States-General, to finance his army of 30,000 men necessary to defend France. They were extremely suspicious of the question of public finances (angered by the devaluations brought about by repeated monetary changes), and would only accept a rise in the salt tax (the gabelle) if the States-General were able to control the application and the usage of the funds raised by it. The officers who would raise the tax had to be designated by the States-General, and ten representatives had to be on the king's counsel of the king in order to check the finances. This ordinance was ratified on 28 December 1355. \nThe Battle of Poitiers occurred on the 19 September 1356. In a new disaster for France, John II came close to victory but he and one of his young sons, Philip the Bold, were captured.\nThe beginnings of the Dauphin Charles's regency were fraught with difficulty, only 18, with little experience or personal prestige (unlike his father and brother he had quit the field of battle at Poitiers), and carrying the shame of the Valois dynasty on his shoulders.

The deputies of the Third Estate numbered 400. He faced a strong opposition - Étienne Marcel headed the Bourgeoisie and the friends of Charles of Navarre regrouped around Robert le Coq, Bishop of Laon. Within the States-General, a committee of 80 members, formed on its own initiative to facilitate discussions, supported their claims. The States-General declared the Dauphin the king's lieutenant and defender of the kingdom in his father's absence and assigned him a counsel of twenty men (twelve nobles, twelve bourgeois and four clerks) as foreseen by the order of 1355. \n\nÉtienne Marcel sought to reform the government and the administration of the kingdom. In return for allowing the king to raise new taxes, he demanded the discharge of the seven most compromised counselors and the freeing of the King of Navarre. On these conditions, the states were disposed to vote for the period of one year the Dauphin an aid of a décime and a half on all the three orders' revenues. Not powerful enough to refuse these suggestions straight away, the Dauphin postponed his response (on the pretext of waiting for messengers from his father)), dissolved the States-General and left Paris for Metz to render homage to his maternal uncle emperor Charles IV. But, lacking money, he soon found himself at the mercy of Marcel, who had seized upon the indignation provoked by a new ordinance to change the currency (published on 10 December 1356) and caused all the guilds to take up arms; the Dauphin had to accept the dismissal of his counsellors, cancel the currency change and recall the States-General, to meet at the start of February 1357. On 3 March, after stormy debates, the Dauphin accepted the promulgation of the major "grande ordonnance" that had been voted for on 28 December during the States-General of 1355 and that his father had ratified just before departing to fight the English in summer 1356. Nine of the Dauphin's advisors were dismissed. Six representatives of the states entered the King's Council, which became a Guardianship Council.

His attempts to collect unpaid poll taxes in Brentwood ended in a violent confrontation, which rapidly spread across the southeast of the country. A wide spectrum of rural society, including many local artisans and village officials, rose up in protest, burning court records and opening the local prisons.

The hunt for Flemings continued, and those with Flemish-sounding accents were killed, including the royal adviser, Richard Lyons. In one city ward, the bodies of 40 executed Flemings were piled up in the street, and at the Church of St Martin Vintry, popular with the Flemish, 35 of the community were killed.Isolated inside the Tower, the royal government was in a state of shock at the turn of events. The King left the castle that morning and made his way to negotiate with the rebels at Mile End in east London, taking only a very small bodyguard with him.The King left Sudbury and Hales behind in the Tower, either for their own safety or because Richard had decided it would be safer to distance himself from his unpopular ministers.\nIt is uncertain who spoke for the rebels at Mile End, and Wat Tyler may not have been present on this occasion, but they appear to have put forward their various demands to the King, including the surrender of the hated officials on their lists for execution; the abolition of serfdom and unfree tenure; "that there should be no law within the realm save the law of Winchester", and a general amnesty for the rebels. It is unclear precisely what was meant by the law of Winchester, but it probably referred to the rebel ideal of self-regulating village communities.\nWhile Richard was at Mile End, the Tower was taken by the rebels. Once inside, the rebels began to hunt down their key targets, and found Archbishop Sudbury and Robert Hales in the chapel of the White Tower. Along with William Appleton, John of Gaunt's physician, and John Legge, a royal sergeant, they were taken out to Tower Hill and beheaded. The rebels found John of Gaunt's son, the future Henry IV, and were about to execute him as well, when John Ferrour, one of the royal guards, successfully interceded on his behalf.

Richard queried why Tyler and the rebels had not yet left London following the signing of the charters the previous day, but this brought an angry rebuke from Tyler, who requested that a further charter be drawn up. The rebel leader rudely demanded refreshment and, once this had been provided, attempted to leave.\nAn argument then broke out between Tyler and some of the royal servants. The Lord Mayor of London, William Walworth, stepped forward to intervene, Tyler made some motion towards the King, and the royal soldiers leapt in. Either Walworth or Richard ordered Tyler to be arrested, Tyler attempted to attack the Mayor, and Walworth responded by stabbing Tyler.

 flavor_hyw.1106.d:1 "The royal suppression of the revolt began shortly after the death of Wat Tyler on 15 June. Sir Robert Knolles, Sir Nicholas Brembre and Sir Robert Launde were appointed to restore control in the capital. A summons was put out for soldiers, probably around 4,000 men were mustered in London, and expeditions to the other troubled parts of the country soon followed.\nA wide range of laws were invoked in the process of the suppression, from general treason to charges of book burning or demolishing houses, a process complicated by the relatively narrow definition of treason at the time. The use of informants and denunciations became common, causing fear to spread across the country; by November at least 1,500 people had been executed or killed in battle. Many of those who had lost property in the revolt attempted to seek legal compensation, and John of Gaunt made particular efforts to track down those responsible for destroying his Savoy Palace.znDespite the violence of the suppression, the government and local lords were relatively circumspect in restoring order after the revolt, and continued to be worried about fresh revolts for several decades. Few lords took revenge on their peasants except through the legal processes of the courts.\nThere were no further attempts by Parliament to impose a poll tax or to reform England's fiscal system. The Commons instead concluded at the end of 1381 that the military effort on the Continent should be "carefully but substantially reduced". Unable to raise fresh taxes, the government had to curtail its foreign policy and military expeditions and began to examine the options for peace."

Prior to 1382, Wycliffite beliefs were tolerated in government as they endorsed in royal superiority to bishops. However, the government and royals were hesitant, as they did not want to encourage subjects to criticize religious powers. After 1382, royalty and nobility found Lollardy to be a threat not only to the Church, but to English society in general. The Lollards' small measure of protection evaporated. This change in status was also affected by the departure of John of Gaunt (Duke of Lancaster, patron of Chaucer and protector of John Wycliffe) who left England in 1386 to pursue the Crown of Castile."

They were sons of Edmund Crouchback, 1st Earl of Lancaster ; the second son of King Henry III and younger brother of King Edward I of England. Henry of Grosmont was thus a first cousin once removed of King Edward II and a second cousin of King Edward III.\nAt about age 18, he married Isabel of Beaumont; daughter of Henry de Beaumont, Earl of Buchan and veteran campaigner of the First War of Scottish Independence. He and Isabel had two daughters. The eldest was Maud of Lancaster, who married William I, Duke of Bavaria in 1352. The younger was Blanche of Lancaster, who married her third cousin John of Gaunt, the third of five surviving sons of Edward III. Gaunt inherited Lancaster's possessions, and he was granted the ducal title the following year, but it was not until 1377, when Edward was largely incapacitated, that Gaunt was able to recover the palatinate rights for the County of Lancaster."

Among Chaucer's many other works are The Book of the Duchess, The House of Fame, The Legend of Good Women, and Troilus and Criseyde. He is seen as crucial in legitimising the literary use of Middle English when the dominant literary languages in England were still Anglo-Norman French and Latin. Around 1366, Chaucer married Philippa de Roet. She was a lady-in-waiting to Edward III's queen, Philippa of Hainault, and a sister of Katherine Swynford, who later  became the third wife of John of Gaunt."

His health continued to deteriorate and the prince's personal doctor advised him to return to England. Edward left Aquitaine with the Duke of Lancaster, and landed at Southampton early in January 1371. Edward met his father at Windsor. At this meeting, Prince Edward interceded to stop a treaty Edward III had made the previous month with Charles of Navarre because he did not agree to the ceding of lands King Charles demanded in it.

She became the mistress of the king, Edward III around 1366, when she was around 18 years old and the king 55. The king showered Perrers with gifts, quickly making her an extremely wealthy woman. She amassed a fortune of more than £20,000. She was paraded around London in golden garments as the "Lady of the Sun" at the king's command, causing a wave of public criticism. Perrer's power further grew between 1370 and 1376. She reportedly provoked fear, and no one dared to sue her. She was seen as an ambitious, calculating, cold-hearted opportunist who manipulated the elderly king. Towards the end of Edward III's life, Perrers was even accused of making his life miserable. \nAs the king's health was ailing, Perrers contracted a secret marriage in November 1375, at the age of 27, with 53-year-old Sir William de Windsor, Baron Windsor to ensure her safety and livelihood after Edward's death. He was the king's lieutenant in Ireland. De Windsor spent long periods of time away from England, thus making it less probable that the king would discover the marriage. The couple remained together until the death of the husband on 15 September 1384, but had no children."

 death_of_black_prince.11.desc:1 "While the early years of Edward's reign had been energetic and successful, his final years in power were marked by apathy, military failures and political unrest. The daily affairs of state had interested Edward less than his military campaigns. Thus, during the 1360s, Edward relied increasingly on the help of his subordinates, particularly William Wykeham . Wykeham, an upstart, was made Lord Privy Seal in 1363 and Lord Chancellor in 1367, although Parliament forced him to relinquish the chancellorship in 1371 because of political difficulties linked.\nIncreasingly, Edward began to rely on his sons for the leadership of military operations. The king's second son, Lionel of Antwerp, attempted to subdue by force the largely autonomous Anglo-Irish lords in Ireland. The venture failed, and the only lasting mark he left were the suppressive Statutes of Kilkenny in 1366. In France, meanwhile, the decade following the Treaty of Brétigny was one of relative tranquillity, but on 8 April 1364 John II died in captivity in England, after unsuccessfully trying to raise his own ransom at home. He was followed by the vigorous Charles V, who enlisted the help of the capable Bertrand du Guesclin, Constable of France In 1369, the French war started anew, and Edward's son John of Gaunt was given the responsibility of a military campaign. The effort failed, and with the Treaty of Bruges in 1375, the great English possessions in France were reduced to only the coastal towns of Calais, Bordeaux, and Bayonne.\nMilitary failure abroad, and the associated fiscal pressure of constant campaigns, led to political discontent in England. Finance was a particular grievance; although it was rarely raised as an issue before 1371, after that time complaints about the royal household's expenditure were frequent. The problems came to a head in the Parliament of 1376, the so-called Good Parliament. The Parliament was called to grant taxation, but the House of Commons took the opportunity to address specific grievances. In particular, criticism was directed at some of the King's closest advisors. Lord Chamberlain William Latimer, 4th Baron Latimer, and Steward of the Household John Neville, 3rd Baron Neville de Raby, were dismissed from their positions."

From then until 1377, he was effectively the head of the English government due to the illness of his father and elder brother, who were unable to exercise authority. His vast estates made him the richest man in England, and his great wealth, ostentatious display of it, autocratic manner and attitudes, enormous London mansion (the Savoy Palace on the Strand) and association with the failed peace process at Bruges combined to make him the most visible target of social resentments. His time at the head of government was marked by the so-called Good Parliament of 1376 and the Bad Parliament of 1377. The first, called to grant massive war taxation to the Crown, turned into a parliamentary revolution, with the Commons (supported to some extent by the Lords) venting their grievances at decades of crippling taxation, misgovernment, and suspected endemic corruption among the ruling classes. John was left isolated (even the Black Prince supported the need for reform) and the Commons refused to grant money for the war unless most of the great officers of state were dismissed and the king's mistress Alice Perrers, another focus of popular resentment, was barred from any further association with him. But even after the government acceded to virtually all their demands, the Commons then refused to authorise any funds for the war, losing the sympathy of the Lords as a result."

English monarchs had therefore historically held titles and lands within France, which made them vassals to the kings of France. The status of the English king's French fiefs was a major source of conflict between the two monarchies throughout the Middle Ages. \nAlthough the official pretext was the interruption of the direct male line of the Capetian dynasty, the legality of those continental possessions of English was the root cause as French monarchs systematically sought to check the growth of English power, stripping away lands as the opportunity arose, particularly whenever England was at war with Scotland, an ally of France. English holdings in France had varied in size, at some points dwarfing even the French royal domain; by 1337, however, only Gascony was English.\nIn 1328, Charles IV of France died without any sons or brothers, and a new principle was established by Charles' predecessor Philip V and himself, Salic law, disallowed female succession. Charles's closest male relative was his nephew Edward III of England, whose mother, Isabella, was Charles's sister. Isabella claimed the throne of France for her son by the rule of proximity of blood, but the French nobility rejected this, maintaining that Isabella could not transmit a right she did not possess. An assembly of French barons decided that a native Frenchman should receive the crown, rather than Edward.\nSo the throne passed instead to Charles's patrilineal cousin, Philip, Count of Valois becoming Philip VI of France. Edward protested but ultimately submitted and did homage for Gascony. Further French disagreements with Edward induced Philip, during May 1337, to meet with his Great Council in Paris. It was agreed that Gascony should be taken back into Philip's hands, which prompted Edward to renew his claim for the French throne, this time by force of arms.\nNow that France had came up with an interesting idea to solve the complex legality of the duchy, a Prince of Blood shall rule it instead of our king and become a permenant subject of French monarchy thus completely removing the sore point between the two nations."

He impaled his arms with those of the Spanish kingdom. From 1372, John gathered around himself a small court of refugee Castilian knights and ladies and set up a Castilian chancery that prepared documents in his name according to the style of Peter of Castile, dated by the Castilian era and signed by himself with the Spanish formula "Yo El Rey" ("I, the King").He hatched several schemes to make good his claim with an army, but for many years these were still-born due to lack of finance or the conflicting claims of war in France or with Scotland."

Charles of Navarre was 'born of the fleur-de-lys on both sides', as he liked to point out, but he succeeded to a shrunken inheritance as far as his French lands were concerned. He always hoped for a long time for recognition of his claim to the crown of France (as the heir-general of Philip IV through his mother, and a Capetian through his father)."
