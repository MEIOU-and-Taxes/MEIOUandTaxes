 flavor_uef.200.title: "France and the Estates-General"
 flavor_uef.200.desc: "As per their ancient privileges, the Seventeen Provinces does not give taxes nor joins the overlord's wars. In order to make them do so, you will need to use the 'Subjugate Vassal' diplomatic action. However, this action revokes their ancient privileges and this might anger the local nobles as well as the burghers and the peasantry, who would bear the most of the tax burden.\n\nUpon the creation of the Seventeen Provinces, representatives from all over the Low Countries have been called to the Estates-General of the Netherlands. You can demand taxes and manpower from them, and they will vote on your request and come to a decision. Too many requests might anger them and increase the chances that they refuse. Also, you can increase the centralisation efforts in the Low Countries every 50 years. This increases the level of the Estates-General province modifier (there are 3 levels), thus reducing autonomy in the provinces. Also, increasing centralisation increases the money and manpower they give you upon accepting your tax/manpower requests. Finally, more centralisation decreases the chance that people will be angry at you if you try to subjugate them via using the diplomatic action. Thus, increasing centralisation efforts before attempting to subjugate is highly recommended.\n\nYou can access this event via taking the 'More Information on the Seventeen Provinces' decision."
