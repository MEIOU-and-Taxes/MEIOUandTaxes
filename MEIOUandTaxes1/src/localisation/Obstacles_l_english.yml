 overcome_magnates_title:1 "£greater_nobles£ Crush the power of the magnates"
 overcome_magnates_desc:1 "The magnates compete for men and resources with the state - and the state does not suffer competition well.  They must be crushed if we are to reestablish full authority over our empire.  Doing so will not only require a great deal of effort and danger, it will also require us to be able to replace them with a bureaucracy loyal to the empire - otherwise, we would simply create a new set of landowners who would turn against us, in time."
 establish_succession_title:1 "£bureaucracy£ Establish clear succession rules"
 establish_succession_desc:1 "Everyone agrees our nation's rules of succession are problematic - but actually changing the rules will be difficult.  Many powerful families have vested interests in keeping the rules intact, and even if the laws are changed there is no guarantee that they will be followed after our ruler's death.  In order to ensure succession laws are followed even when it seems advantageous to place a different candidate on the throne, new laws must be entrenched with a bureaucracy able to enforce them."
 establish_military_administration_title:1 "Establish a central military administration"
 establish_military_administration_desc:1 "Our army needs a central administration to standardise recruitment, training, logistics and command.  Doing so will require us to force our will upon each province and town, bypassing generations of tradition to create a New Model Army worth the name."
 obstacle_military_administration:1 "Disorganised military"
 desc_obstacle_military_administration:1 "Our nation's central military administration has collapsed.  Individual provinces and cities raised their own forces during a war, often trying to get around this obligation as much as possible.  Not only does this make it difficult to raise a large army, it also means our army lacks cohesion.  It is made up of many smaller units that are armed and trained differently than their peers who often resisted serving under officers other than their own.  A strong ruler could overcome these obstacles, but a weak one could be overwhelmed by them. /n  - Global Manpower: §R-10%§!"
 obstacle_succession:1 "Succession by the Sword"
 desc_obstacle_succession:1 "Empires have been won by strong rulers and lost by weak ones.  Knowing this, our generals stand ready to replace the ruler with a stronger candidate if he shows signs of weakness.  Unfortunately, this ensures a steady stream of challenges to a central authority - sometimes from children and grandchildren, other times from governors and generals, most believing they were saving the empire by rebelling."
 obstacle_magnates:1 "Powerful Magnates"
 desc_obstacle_magnates:1 "An increasing reliance on local elites during times of crisis has led to the decentralisation of the state.  A large landowning class known as Magnates have emerged to challenge the authority of the state, competing for men and resources with the state even during civil wars and foreign invasions.  In some places, the magnates were practically independent of the state, only banding together against central authority."
 obstacle_traditional_military:1 "Army of Warriors"
 desc_obstacle_traditional_military:1 "Our soldiers pride themselves on being warriors first, soldiers second.  They train hard - lifting weights, fencing, and riding on horseback.  They fight bravely and hard.  But in return they expect to be treated as elites: greatly rewarded, allowed to duel each other, and given the freedom to fight as they wish in battle.  This means our army lacks discipline and is unable to use formations effectively.  It also means our troops reject the use of unmanly weapons such as guns in favour of more traditional weapons such as the sword and lance."
 obstacle_establish_professional_army_title:1 "Establish an army of soldiers"
 obstacle_establish_professional_army_desc:1 "Our army is made up of excellent warriors but terrible soldiers.  They do not follow orders and reject the hard discipline needed of a modern military.  In order to keep up with our rivals militarily, we must break their spirit and reform our army into one made up of obedient soldiers - something that our own troops will keenly resist."
 obstacle_feudal_fragmentation:1 "Feudal Fragmentation"
 desc_obstacle_feudal_fragmentation:1 "In theory our ruler is unparalleled.  In practise, however, his control over the nation is limited.  The many nobles and governors who have pledged fealty to him act independently, fighting each other to expand the lands under their control.  This fighting has become so fierce that at times only the capital can truly be claimed to be under our control!"
 obstacle_reunite_nation_title:1 "End the fragmentation of our nation"
 obstacle_reunite_nation_desc:1 "The independent warlords who rule most of our nation must be brought to heel!  Anyone could be defeated on the field of battle; what is needed is a more permanent solution, to change the system so that governors and generals no longer have the freedom to declare themselves petty kings.  Only then can we truly claim to be an empire once more."
 obstacle_feuding:1 "Constant Feuding"
 desc_obstacle_feuding:1 "Our ruling dynasty has many members who are constantly at each other's throats.  Their frequent plots and feuds occasionally spill over into actual violence."
 obstacle_shifting_loyalties:1 "Shifting Loyalties"
 desc_obstacle_shifting_loyalties:1 "The people under our rule bear no special loyalty to us.  Inheritors of an ancient legacy, they see us as just another dynasty of conquerors, soon to be pushed aside by another one.  For this reason, our soldiers are willing to fight only as long as we keep winning, and our governors are willing to open the city gates should an enemy army arrive."
 obstacle_win_loyalty_title:1 "Win the loyalty of our people"
 obstacle_win_loyalty_desc:1 "Our people see us as temporary dictators to be suffered, not leaders worth fighting for.  To gain the loyalty of the people, we must prove to them that we are not foreign barbarians who will disappear as quickly as we came."
 obstacle_end_family_feud_title:1 "Replace noble governors with bureaucrats"
 obstacle_end_family_feud_desc:1 "Appointing family members to key positions in government is a tradition going back to our roots, but it has caused us nothing but grief.  In order to stop the constant feuding between high-ranking officials, we must attempt two very difficult tasks: first, we must remove our own distant relatives from power, something that they will resist tooth and nail.  Second, we must replace them with a skilled bureaucracy who owe their loyalty to their ruler, not their family.  To do otherwise would be to replace one serpent with another."
 fueros:1 "Fueros"
 desc_fueros:1 "In order to secure the integration of our kingdoms to form the nation of Spain, our ruler swore to recognise the traditional freedoms of the lands swearing fealty to the union of the crown.  This collection of laws and rights is known as the Fueros, and it effectively means the people of this region enjoy considerable autonomy."
 revoke_the_fueros_title:1 "Revoke the Fueros"
 revoke_the_fueros_desc:1 "The treaty signed by the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to secure the creation of [Root.Country.GetName] forced [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] to recognise the traditional freedoms of the people submitting to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] rule.  This humiliation has greatly limited the authority of the central government, not to mention royal revenues!  With enough authority, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] could pass a law to revoke these traditional rights and enforce one set of laws upon the kingdom - but the people would hate it."
 obstacle_gavelkind:1 "Shared Succession"
 desc_obstacle_gavelkind:1 "Our nation has a tradition of passing out fiefs to all sons and heirs of its ruler.  Over the generations these fiefs grow more independent, causing the breakup of the empire."
