 ### HRE Defence Events
 HRE_war_mechanics.001.t:1 "Defence of the Empire"
 HRE_war_mechanics.001.d:1 "The Empire is under attack by outside aggressors. Shall we ask the princes for help? \n\nRemember the following: \nIf the HRE alliance is stronger than the attacker alliance, the princes will most likely not contribute anything. If the alliances are on same strength, many princes will contribute to the war. If the enemy alliance is (significantly) stronger than the HRE alliance, almost all princes will contribute."
 HRE_war_mechanics.001.Ask_empire_for_help:1 "Demand Heerfolge from all princes!"
 HRE_war_mechanics.001.Ask_empire_for_help.ctp:1 "This will call for a Hoftag, in which the imperial estates will discuss if they want do give you help. It's likely they will help you. Also this will decrease the authority of the emperor. If they accept, all princes will be asked to support you in the war. They can give you manpower and money or only money. If they help you depends on your opinion to them, the imperial authority and the reform desire of the empire. If the reform desire is high, they princes might request reforms before they give you help."
 HRE_war_mechanics.001.Ask_great_princes_for_help:1 "Demand Heerfolge from the electors and the strong princes!"
 HRE_war_mechanics.001.Ask_great_princes_for_help.ctp:1 "This will just ask for the help of the strong princes and the electors. It's relatively unlike they will help you. Only if you have good relations, they will do it. Perhaps they will request some privileges for it. They can give you manpower and money or only money. It will strengthen the authority of the electors in the empire and therefore weaken that of the emperor."
 HRE_war_mechanics.001.Do_it_alone:1 "No, the forces from our own domain shall suffice."
 HRE_war_mechanics.001.Do_it_alone.ctp: "You won't get help from the princes, but strengthen your authority in the empire, because you show that the emperor is strong enough to fend off the invader. If you later try to call for help anyways, you will suffer greater penalties."
 HRE_war_mechanics.002.t:1 "Defence of the Empire"
 HRE_war_mechanics.002.d:1 "The empire is under siege and the emperor asks us to supply our contingent to the Army of the Holy Roman Empire. What shall be our reply?"

 HRE_war_mechanics.002.manpower.ctp:1 "We will send the emperor 10% of our maximum manpower and 2.5% of our yearly income to defend the empire. This means losing [Root.supplied_manpower_display.GetValue]£icon_manpower£ and [Root.part_money_contr.GetValue]¤"

 HRE_war_mechanics.002.refuse.ctp:1 "As the entirety of the empire decided to take defensive action, we violate the imperial law by not helping. This worsens our relations with all HRE members and more so with the emperor for quite some time."

 HRE_war_mechanics.003.d:1 "Our envoys return with news from our subjects. We managed to muster [Root.supplied_manpower_display.GetValue] men and [Root.supplied_money.GetValue] ducats. The knights are assembled and war logistics organised. The enemy will face the full might of the empire!"
 HRE_war_mechanics.003.a:1 "I hope this will be enough."
 HRE_war_mechanics.004.t:1 "The Imperial War Comes to an End"
