 castilian_civil_war.1.name: "Castilian Civil War"
 castilian_civil_war.1.desc: "During the past century the Castilian nobility have time and time again actively tried to interfere with the succession of the Castilian crown and have not flinched from allying outside powers. A new such battle seems to be brewing and the succession is again in question. The legitimacy of the current heir is being questioned by some leading nobles who would prefer a relative of the King aligned with the Aragonese Crown. Meanwhile the supporters of [Root.Heir.GetName] are making overtures to the Portuguese crown in order to secure the position of their candidate.\n\nThings have now spiraled into open conflict and it seems increasingly likely that the faction without royal support will attempt to put their candidate directly on the throne rather than in queue for it. Some parts of the nobility remain undecided yet, and some have chosen to make use of this opportunity to protest against perceived infringement of their old rights in general."
