 desc_death_of_black_prince:1 "The dramatic reverse of fortune between England and France. English are paralysed by one diasters after another which ultimately ended with the death of Black Prince before his own ailing father Edward III too. A boy aged nine ruled in name only, surrounded by powerful dukes who were all of royal descent and capable of challenging the crown."

 death_of_black_prince.1.d:1 "The death of his eldest son, Edward of Angoulême, in 1371, caused Edward a great deal of grief. His health continued to deteriorate and the prince's personal doctor advised him to return to England. Edward left Aquitaine with the Duke of Lancaster, and landed at Southampton early in January 1371. Edward met his father at Windsor. At this meeting, Prince Edward interceded to stop a treaty Edward III had made the previous month with Charles of Navarre because he did not agree to the ceding of lands King Charles demanded in it. After this, the Black Prince returned to his manor in Berkhamsted."

 death_of_black_prince.10.d:1 "Perrers became a part of the household of Queen death_of_black_prince before 1359. She became the mistress of the king, Edward III around 1366, when she was around 18 years old and the king 55. The king showered Perrers with gifts, quickly making her an extremely wealthy woman. She amassed a fortune of more than £20,000. She was paraded around London in golden garments as the "Lady of the Sun" at the king's command, causing a wave of public criticism. Perrer's power further grew between 1370 and 1376. She reportedly provoked fear, and no one dared to sue her. She was seen as an ambitious, calculating, cold-hearted opportunist who manipulated the elderly king. Towards the end of Edward III's life, Perrers was even accused of making his life miserable. \nAs the king's health was ailing, Perrers contracted a secret marriage in November 1375, at the age of 27, with 53-year-old Sir William de Windsor, Baron Windsor to ensure her safety and livelihood after Edward's death. He was the king's lieutenant in Ireland. De Windsor spent long periods of time away from England, thus making it less probable that the king would discover the marriage. The couple remained together until the death of the husband on 15 September 1384, but had no children."

 death_of_black_prince.11.desc:1 "While the early years of Edward's reign had been energetic and successful, his final years in power were marked by apathy, military failures and political unrest. The daily affairs of state had interested Edward less than his military campaigns. Thus, during the 1360s, Edward relied increasingly on the help of his subordinates, particularly William Wykeham . Wykeham, an upstart, was made Lord Privy Seal in 1363 and Lord Chancellor in 1367, although Parliament forced him to relinquish the chancellorship in 1371 because of political difficulties linked.\nIncreasingly, Edward began to rely on his sons for the leadership of military operations. The king's second son, Lionel of Antwerp, attempted to subdue by force the largely autonomous Anglo-Irish lords in Ireland. The venture failed, and the only lasting mark he left were the suppressive Statutes of Kilkenny in 1366. In France, meanwhile, the decade following the Treaty of Brétigny was one of relative tranquillity, but on 8 April 1364 John II died in captivity in England, after unsuccessfully trying to raise his own ransom at home. He was followed by the vigorous Charles V, who enlisted the help of the capable Bertrand du Guesclin, Constable of France In 1369, the French war started anew, and Edward's son John of Gaunt was given the responsibility of a military campaign. The effort failed, and with the Treaty of Bruges in 1375, the great English possessions in France were reduced to only the coastal towns of Calais, Bordeaux, and Bayonne.\nMilitary failure abroad, and the associated fiscal pressure of constant campaigns, led to political discontent in England. Finance was a particular grievance; although it was rarely raised as an issue before 1371, after that time complaints about the royal household's expenditure were frequent. The problems came to a head in the Parliament of 1376, the so-called Good Parliament. The Parliament was called to grant taxation, but the House of Commons took the opportunity to address specific grievances. In particular, criticism was directed at some of the King's closest advisors. Lord Chamberlain William Latimer, 4th Baron Latimer, and Steward of the Household John Neville, 3rd Baron Neville de Raby, were dismissed from their positions."

It was the longest parliament of his time from 28 April to 10 July.\nOnce the members were assembled, they were determined to clean up the corrupt Royal Council. Peter de la Mare, a knight of the shire representing Herefordshire, had been elected as Speaker by the House of Commons, and on the first day he delivered an address criticising England's recent military failures, condemning the corruption at court, and calling for close scrutiny of the royal accounts. Richard Lyons (Warden of the Mint) and Lord Latimer, who were believed to be robbing the treasury, were called before Parliament and then imprisoned. Latimer's impeachment is the earliest recorded in Parliament. The king's mistress, Alice Perrers, was called and condemned to seclusion."

 death_of_black_prince.15.d:1 "On his return from France in 1374, John of Gaunt took a more decisive and persistent role in the direction of English foreign policy. From then until 1377, he was effectively the head of the English government due to the illness of his father and elder brother, who were unable to exercise authority. His vast estates made him the richest man in England, and his great wealth, ostentatious display of it, autocratic manner and attitudes, enormous London mansion (the Savoy Palace on the Strand) and association with the failed peace process at Bruges combined to make him the most visible target of social resentments. His time at the head of government was marked by the so-called Good Parliament of 1376 and the Bad Parliament of 1377. The first, called to grant massive war taxation to the Crown, turned into a parliamentary revolution, with the Commons (supported to some extent by the Lords) venting their grievances at decades of crippling taxation, misgovernment, and suspected endemic corruption among the ruling classes. John was left isolated (even the Black Prince supported the need for reform) and the Commons refused to grant money for the war unless most of the great officers of state were dismissed and the king's mistress Alice Perrers, another focus of popular resentment, was barred from any further association with him. But even after the government acceded to virtually all their demands, the Commons then refused to authorise any funds for the war, losing the sympathy of the Lords as a result."

 desc_richardii_crisis:1 "Richard II's favroutisim towards the de la Pole family who was later made Earl of Suffolk caused much irks among old nobilities who despised the marchent upstart. Another member of the close circle around the King wa Robert de Vere, Earl of Oxford caused deep displeasure to King's uncle Duke of Gloucester.\n At the parliament of October in 1386, Michael de la Pole, in his capacity of chancellor requested taxation of an unprecedented level for the defence of the realm. Rather than consenting, the parliament responded by refusing to consider any request until the chancellor was removed. The parliament (later known as the Wonderful Parliament) was presumably working with the support of Gloucester and Arundel. The King famously responded that he would not dismiss as much as a scullion from his kitchen at parliament's request. Only when threatened with deposition was Richard forced to give in and let de la Pole go. A commission was set up to review and control royal finances for a year. Richard was deeply perturbed by this affront to his royal prerogative, and from February to November 1387 went on a "gyration" (tour) of the country to muster support for his cause. By installing de Vere as Justice of Chester, he began the work of creating a loyal military power base in Cheshire. He also secured a legal ruling from Chief Justice Robert Tresilian that parliament's conduct had been unlawful and treasonable."

In 1386, he was appointed Admiral of England and Knight of the Order of the Garter.\nFitzAlan allied himself with Thomas de Woodstock, Duke of Gloucester, who was opposed to the pacifist policy of the king in France. They both put pressure on the king and get admission to the King's Council. In August 1387, the king replaced them there with his favourites Michael de la Pole, Robert de Vere, Alexandre Neville, Robert Tresilian and Nicolas Brembre. In response, Gloucester and FitzAlan took up arms against the king with Thomas de Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, Henry Bolingbroke and Thomas de Mowbray."

At Shrewsbury and Nottingham in August he received vigorous reaffirmation of his rights from the royal courts. News of the judges’ opinions frightened the king’s critics, who reacted by bringing an accusatio, or formal appeal, against his allies of treason. The Lords Appellant, as they were now called—the duke of Gloucester and the earls of Warwick, Arundel, Nottingham, and Derby mobilized their retinues in self-defense.\nRichard dispatched his friend Robert de Vere southward with an armed force, but de Vere was defeated at Radcot Bridge on December 20, 1387. A few days later London was occupied by the Appellants. Richard returned to his capital humiliated.\nRichard has no recourse, therefore has to accept the demands of his opponents. mayor of London, Nicolas Brembre and Chief Justice Robert Tresilian were convicted and executed, while de Vere and de la Pole who were exiled already were sentenced to death in absentia at the “Pitiless Parliament” in February 1388. But the Appellant went even further and Richard's knights were also executed, including Richard's friend  Simon de Burley. They thus manage to completely break the circle of favourites around the king"

 richardii_crisis.12.t:1 "Truce with France"
 richardii_crisis.12.d:1 "Richard gradually restored a semblance of royal authority in the months following the ruthless parliament, thanks to three factors. First, the aggressive foreign policy pursued by the “Lords Appellant” fails. Indeed, their efforts to build a broad coalition against France led to nothing, and the North of England suffered a Scottish incursion that led to the English defeat of Otterburn. Then Richard is now 21 years old and can now confidently claim the right to govern himself. Finally, John of Ghent returned to England in 1389 and once his dispute with the king resolved, the old statesman acted as moderator to English politicians. In France, the young Charles VI, who also had the guardianship of his uncles, has just taken power.\nOnce political stability was restored, Richard began to negotiate a lasting peace with France. A proposal made in 1393 offered England possession of Aquitaine. However, it was not endorsed because the condition that the King of England was to pay homage to the King of France was unacceptable to the English people. Peace negotiations may well end when Charles VI has his first symptoms of madness, leaving the French government in an uncomfortable situation. But Richard finally decided not to try to take advantage of these events and signed a first truce, which would have to be followed by further negotiations."

 richardii_crisis.15.d:1 "In December 1387, the two armies met at Radcot-on-Thames where the Lords Appellant's army won the Battle of Radcot Bridge against the forces of Robert de Vere. The victory placed the anti-Ricardian Lords Appellant in a position of incontestable strength. Richard fled Westminster for London and barricaded himself in the Tower of London. On 27 December the Appellant's army reached the tower in full battle array and forced Richard to surrender. When the leading Appellants, the Duke of Gloucester (Thomas of Woodstock) and the Earls of Arundel, Warwick, Derby (Henry Bolingbroke, later Henry IV) and Nottingham, met with Richard on an improvised throne, they seized him and threatened to execute him for his dealings with France. Ultimately they decided against it, instead forcing him to call a session of Parliament.\nDuring the parliament, the Appellants pursued their earlier accusations against Richard and his inner circle, almost wholly unopposed. They levelled a series of charges against Richard's advisers, accusing them of offering to surrender English-held fortresses in France and widespread embezzlement from the treasury.The session continued through April and May as Richard's chamber knights were tried and executed."

Richard was effectively their puppet until the return of John of Gaunt from his Spanish campaigns in 1389. The power of the Appellants rested on popular support from the Commons in Parliament, but by the end of 1388 this support had already begun to wane. In the subsequent Parliament held at Cambridge in September 1388, the Commons were highly critical of the Appellants' record in government. Indeed, it has been argued that the Appellants were predominantly concerned with the task of destroying various members of Richard II's court, and after this objective had been achieved they ceased to concern themselves with the governance of England."

 richardii_crisis.17.d:1 "In the last years of Richard's reign, and particularly in the months after the suppression of the appellants in 1397, the King enjoyed a virtual monopoly on power in the country, a relatively uncommon situation in medieval England. In this period a particular court culture was allowed to emerge, one that differed sharply from that of earlier times. A new form of address developed; where the King previously had been addressed simply as "highness", now "royal majesty", or "high majesty" were often used. It was said that on solemn festivals Richard would sit on his throne in the royal hall for hours without speaking, and anyone on whom his eyes fell had to bow his knees to the King. The inspiration for this new sumptuousness and emphasis on dignity came from the courts on the continent, not only the French and Bohemian courts that had been the homes of Richard's two wives, but also the court that his father had maintained while residing in Aquitaine."

 richardii_crisis.18.t:1 "Belever of royal prerogative"
 richardii_crisis.18.d:1 "Richard articulated a radically new vision of kingship in England, rejecting the tradition of warrior monarchy epitomized by Edward III. Richard’s kingship owed much to the ideas of the 13th-century writer Giles of Rome. Giles argued that all personal honour and privilege flowed from the king, whom the subjects should obey. Richard said the same about honour in his patents of ennoblement, and he and his ministers likewise emphasized the need for obedience. Giles’s influence on the king overlapped with that of Roman law. In the deposition articles, the king was alleged to have cited the Roman legal principle that 'the laws were in his mouth…or alternatively in his breast.' At the same time, he developed his own private military retinue, larger than that of any English king before him, and gave them livery badges with his White Hart. He was then free to develop a courtly atmosphere in which the king was a distant, venerated figure, and art and culture, rather than warfare, were at the centre."

When Thomas Woodstock's turn comes, the Earl of Nottingham announces his death while he was his prisoner at Calais.\nIt is likely that Richard ordered the murder of Woodstock, thus avoiding having to execute a prince of blood.

The Lancasters are not only the richest family in England, they are of royal line, and thus candidates for the succession of Richard, who has no children94. A quarrel broke out in the very closed circle of the court in 1397 between Henry and Thomas Mowbray - who became Duke of Hereford and Duke of Norfolk . According to Henry, Mowbray stated that they would both be able to claim succession to the throne, as former "Lords Appellant". Mowbray denies having made these words, which are assimilated to betrayal. A parliamentary committee decided that they had to deal with the problem with a duel, but at the last moment Richard chose to exile them, Thomas Mowbray for life, and Henry Bollingbroke for ten years. On 3 February 1399, John of Gaunt died. Rather than make Henry his heir, Richard prolongs his exile indefinitely and the disinherit Henry. Henry now living in Paris. However, it was not completely safe, because the French, under the guardship of Louis I of Orlean who were interested in everything that could disturb Richard and his policy of peace due to his resentment of the Burgundian pro-English peace policies, did not welcome Henry by chance.

Percy takes him at his word and decides not to interfere in this. Most of the king's knights and trusted men followed him to Ireland, and Henry did not really encounter resistance during his campaign to the south. Edmund of Langley, Duke of York, charged with protecting the kingdom in the king's absence, had little alternative but to take the side of Henry. Meanwhile, Richard's return from Ireland was delayed and he did not land in Wales until 24 July He then headed for Conwy, where he met the Earl of Northumberland on 12 August to negotiate. A week later, Richard II went to Henry at Flint Castle with Henry's promise of sparing his life. Then two men returned to London, with the king captive running all the way behind Henry.

This did not stop rumours from circulating for years after that he was still alive and waiting to take back his throne, and that the body displayed was that of Richard's chaplain, a priest named Maudelain, who greatly resembled him.\nRebellions continued throughout the first 10 years of Henry's reign, including the revolt of Owain Glyndwr, who declared himself Prince of Wales in 1400, and the rebellions led by Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland, from 1403.
