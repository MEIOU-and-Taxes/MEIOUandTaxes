 pol_negotiate_nunciature_desc: "Poland has been the outpost of Catholicism in the East ever since King Mieszko I was baptized in the Western Latin Rite, and his successors swore alleagiance to the Holy See.

 pol_reform_sejmiki_desc: "A Sejmiks were one of various local parliaments in the history of Poland and Lithuania. For centuries the sejmiks played an important role in the governance of Poland as the most direct form of political enfranchisement of the nobility. Reform of the Sejmiks was proposed by the 'Act on Regional Sejms'. This law introduced major changes to the electoral ordinance, as it reduced the enfranchisement of the noble class. The voting right became tied to a property qualification; to be eligible to vote, a noble had to own or lease land and pay taxes, or be closely related to another who did. It is now a time to enact the 'Act on Regional Sejms', a significant step in the modernization of our nation's democratic government."

If we manage to succesfully incorporate the articles of the Warsaw confderation into our legal system, it is going to make Poland a much safer and more tolerant place than most of its contemporaneous Europe."
 pol_enlightenment_title: "Polish Englightenment"
 pol_enlightenment_desc: "Polish Enlightenment, while sharing many common qualities with the classical Enlightenment movements of Western Europe, also differed from them in many important aspects. Much of the thought of the Western Enlightenment evolved under the oppressive absolute monarchies and was dedicated towards fighting for more freedom. Western thinkers desired Montesquieu's separation and balance of powers to restrict the nearly unlimited power of their monarchs. Polish Enlightenment, however, developed in a very different background. While men of the Enlightenment in the West wrote about the need for more checks and balances on their kings, Polish Enlightenment was geared towards fighting the abuses stemming from too many checks and balances.

As our country grows larger and the provinces continue to unite, however, a multitude of stadtholders pose certain problems, particularly for the army.

 ### French Missions:
 fra_centralise_state_title: "Centralise State"
 fra_centralise_state_desc: "France was a very decentralised state during the Middle Ages. At the time, Lorraine and Provence were states of the Holy Roman Empire and not a part of France. North of the Loire, the King of France at times fought or allied with one of the great principalities of Normandy, Anjou, Blois-Champagne, Flanders and Burgundy. The duke of Normandy was overlord of the duke of Brittany. South of the Loire were the principalities of Aquitaine, Toulouse and Barcelona. Normandy became the strongest power in the north, while Barcelona became the strongest in the south. The rulers of both fiefs eventually became kings, the former by the conquest of England, and the latter by the succession to Aragon. French suzerainty over Barcelona was only formally relinquished by Saint Louis in 1258."
 fra_edict_of_moulins_title: "Edict of Moulins"
 fra_edict_of_moulins_desc: "The Edict of Moulins (1566) declared that the royal domain (defined in the second article as all the land controlled by the crown for more than ten years) could not be alienated, except in two cases: by interlocking, in the case of financial emergency, with a perpetual option to repurchase the land; and to form an appanage, which must return to the crown in its original state on the extinction of the male line."
 fra_annex_loire_vallee_title: "Control Val de Loire"
 fra_annex_loire_vallee_desc: "In the  Middle Ages, the Loire Valley was the scene of almost continuous struggles from the 10th to the 15th century. They first concern the succession to the crown of England, then the struggle between Capetians and Plantagenets for the possession of the Kingdom of France. The end of the so-called Hundred Years War in 1450 marked the beginning of a new era for the Loire Valley, Charles VII and Louis XI ordering or allowing the construction of what would later be called the Châteaux de la Loire. \nThe Renaissance sees the apogee of the role of the Loire Valley within the Kingdom of France. From Charles VII and Louis XI, who made Tours the capital, until Henri IV who brought it back to Paris in 1594, the center of power remained in the region. The Valois, who discovered a new aesthetic and a new way of life in Italy, never stopped transposing them to the Loire Valley, bringing in many Italian artists and craftsmen, including the most famous of them , Leonardo da Vinci. Thus was born what would later be called the first French Renaissance, during which the royal castles of Amboise and Blois, or built, by the king himself or great lords, "court castles" intended for pleasure, such as that of Chambord by François I, or that of Montsoreau by Jean II de Chambes."

 fra_reconquer_normandie_desc: "Normandy played an important role during the Hundred Years' War , which stretched from 1337 to 1453. If it was not at the origin of the conflict, it quickly became an issue between the King of England and the King of France . The wealth of Normandy , its common past with the English (before 1204, the Duchy of Normandy and the Kingdom of England had the same master) and its geographical proximity to the island explain this particular situation. \nTwo periods emerge in this war: at first, the intervention of the English is episodic since they are content to launch destructive rides through the region. However, a powerful Norman lord, Charles the Bad , by rallying to the English, ignited a civil war which pitted the Normans against each other. \nIn a second time, the English presence is much heavier since they occupy the region for more than three decades, between 1417 and 1450. In 1420, the Treaty of Troyes makes the King of England the heir to the kingdom of France. Normandy then appears as the central element of English France. Finally, the king of France Charles  VII reconquers the rich province and forgives the Normans who collaborated with the enemy. Normandy regains peace but emerges very weakened from the conflict."
 fra_subjugate_bretagne_title: "Subjugate Brittany"
 fra_subjugate_bretagne_desc: "The Treaty of Guérande in 1365 which ended the Breton Succession War, however, stated that in the absence of a male heir from the House of Montfort, the heirs of Joanna of Penthièvre would succeed. By the time Anne was born, her father Francis II was the only male from the Breton House of Montfort, and the Blois-Penthièvre heir was a female, Nicole of Blois, who in 1480 sold her rights over Brittany to King Louis XI of France for the amount of 50,000 écus. In 1488, Francis II was defeated at the Battle of Saint-Aubin-du-Cormier, ending the Mad War (la Guerre Folle) between Brittany and France. In the Treaty of Sablé (19 August 1488), which concluded the peace settlement, the Duke was forced to accept clauses stipulating that his daughters were not to marry without the approval of the King of France. With the death of Francis II soon afterwards (9 September 1488) as a result of a fall from his horse, Brittany was plunged into a fresh crisis, leading to the final Franco-Breton war. On his deathbed, the Duke made his daughter promise never to consent to the subjugation of the Duchy to the Kingdom of France. Anne married Maximillian of Austria by proxy on 19 December 1490, but this is a serious provocation—it not only violated the Treaty of Sablé (the King of France not having consented to the marriage). So Charles VIII invaded Brittany in the spring of 1491 and laid siege to Rennes where Anne stayed. Without any spanish or austrian helps, Anne had no choice but to marry Charles VIII."
 fra_conquer_bourgogne_title: "Subjugate Burgundy"
 fra_conquer_bourgogne_desc: "Mary assumed the rule of her father Charles the Bold's domains upon his defeat in battle and death on 5 January 1477. King Louis XI of France seized the opportunity to attempt to take possession of the Duchy of Burgundy proper and also the regions of Franche-Comté, Picardy and Artois. The king was anxious that Mary should marry his son Charles and thus secure the inheritance of the Low Countries for his heirs, by force of arms if necessary. Burgundy, fearing French military power, sent an embassy to France to negotiate a marriage between Mary and the six-year-old Dauphin (later King Charles VIII)"
 fra_conquer_lorraine_title: "Control Lorraine"
 fra_conquer_lorraine_desc: "The border between the Empire and the Kingdom of France remained relatively stable throughout the Middle Ages. In 1301, Count Henry III of Bar had to receive the western part of his lands (Barrois mouvant) as a fief by King Philip IV of France. In 1475, the Burgundian duke Charles the Bold campaigned for the Duchy of Lorraine, but was finally defeated and killed at the 1477 Battle of Nancy. In the 1552 Treaty of Chambord, a number of insurgent Protestant Imperial princes around Elector Maurice of Saxony ceded the Three Bishoprics to King Henry II of France in turn for his support. Due to the weakening of Imperial authority during the 1618-1648 Thirty Years' War, France was able to occupy the duchy in 1634 and retained it until 1661 when Charles IV was restored. In 1670, the French invaded again, forcing Charles into exile; his nephew and heir Charles V (1643-1690) spent his life in the service of the Imperial House of Habsburg. France returned the Duchy in the 1697 Treaty of Ryswick ending the Nine Years' War and Charles' son Leopold (1679-1729), became duke and was known as 'Leopold the Good;' in the 1701-1714 War of the Spanish Succession, parts of Lorraine, including the capital Nancy, were again occupied by France, but Leopold continued to reign at the Château de Lunéville. In 1737, after the War of the Polish Succession, an agreement between France, the Habsburgs and the Lorraine House of Vaudémont assigned the Duchy to Stanisław Leszczynski, former king of Poland. He was also father-in-law to King Louis XV of France, who lost out to a candidate backed by Russia and Austria in the War of the Polish Succession. The Lorraine duke Francis Stephen, betrothed to the Emperor's daughter Archduchess Maria Theresa, was compensated with the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, where the last Medici ruler had recently died without issue. France also promised to support Maria Theresa as heir to the Habsburg possessions under the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713. Leszczynski received Lorraine with the understanding that it would fall to the French crown on his death. When Stanisław died on 23 February 1766, Lorraine was annexed by France."

Beset by enemies and seeking to gain a free hand in Hungary, the Habsburgs sold their Sundgau territory (mostly in Upper Alsace) to France in 1646, which had occupied it, for the sum of 1.2 million Thalers. When hostilities were concluded in 1648 with the Treaty of Westphalia, most of Alsace was recognized as part of France, although some towns remained independent. "

 fra_reconquer_saintonge_desc: "The region fell under the control of the kings and dukes of Aquitaine, the counts of Anjou, then the counts of Poitiers, before becoming integrated for centuries in the new Duchy of Aquitaine. Occupying the frontier between Capetian and Plantagenet-controlled areas during the late Middle Ages, between 1152 and 1451, it was the site of constant struggles between lords torn between their allegiance to Anglo-Aquitaine and those linked to Paris. Saintonge was primarily attached to Anglo-Aquitaine until the mid-fourteenth century. However, errors by Henry of Grosmont, 1st Duke of Lancaster and Edward, the Black Prince gradually contributed to weakening English power, and the province ultimately came under the control of the King of France, Charles VII, 'the Victorious', in 1453"
 fra_reconquer_guyenne_title: "Reconquer Aquitaine"
 fra_reconquer_guyenne_desc: "In 1337, King Philip VI of France reclaimed the fief of Aquitaine (essentially corresponding to Gascony) from Edward III of England. Edward in turn claimed the entire Kingdom of France as the only grandson of King Philip IV of France. This triggered the Hundred Years' War, in which both the Plantagenets and the House of Valois claimed the supremacy over Aquitaine. In 1360, both sides signed the Treaty of Bretigny, in which Edward renounced the French crown but remained sovereign Lord of Aquitaine (rather than merely duke). \nHowever, when the treaty was broken in 1369, both these English claims and the war resumed. French victory was complete with the Battle of Castillon of 1453. England and France nominally remained at war for another 20 years, but England was in no position to continue its campaign, due to its escalating internal conflicts. The Hundred Years' War was formally concluded with the Treaty of Picquigny of 1475. With the end of the Hundred Years' War, Aquitaine returned under direct rule of the king of France and remained in the possession of the king."

He succeeded his father as Count of Maine, Guise, Mortain and Gien in 1472. He succeeded his uncle René I of Naples in 1480 as forth Duke of Anjou and Count of Provence, according to the will of René who had no surviving son. René's surviving daughter Yolande received Bar and was already Duchess of Lorraine. He also used the title of Duke of Calabria, in token of the claims to Naples he inherited from René. He willed his inheritance to his cousin Louis XI of France, whose heirs thus obtained a claim to the affairs of Italy, pursued in the next decades."

 fra_conquer_milan_desc: "Valentina Visconti was born in Milan as the second of the four children of Gian Galeazzo Visconti, the first Duke of Milan, and his first wife Isabelle, a daughter of King John II the Good of France. The death of his uncle Bernabò in 1385 left Gian Galeazzo as the sole ruler over the Visconti inheritance, and with this Valentina's status changed considerably. Gian Galeazzo eventually chose Louis, Duke of Touraine (later Duke of Orléans), second son of King Charles V of France and brother of the reigning Charles VI. \nValentina received as a dowry the County of Vertus (which was the dowry of her own mother at the time of her marriage in 1348) and the city of Asti, with the sums of 450,000 florins in cash and 75,000 florins in jewelry. In the marriage contract was also stipulated that in absence of male heirs, Valentina would inherit the Visconti dominions. It was because of this, that her grandson Louis XII of France claimed the Duchy of Milan and embarked on the Italian Wars. "

Though he would never reacquire the crown himself René continued to style himself King of Naples throughout his life. With René now gone the Anjou claims to the kingdom are looking increasingly inconsequential.\nThe Neapolitan Kingdom is not without its enemies, however, and some Italian princes have approached [Root.Monarch.GetName] suggesting that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] could claim the Kingdom of Naples for [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] by citing the marriage ties between King René and our own dynasty in the past as a pretext. Normally this would be seen as a very weak claim but due to the impopularity of the Neapolitan rulers and the support from Curia, this might be overlooked."

The college was founded in 1253 by Robert de Sorbon, chaplain and confessor of King Saint Louis. It was one of the first significant colleges of the medieval University of Paris."

Instead they hope for a single nation, strong, unified, and leading the way into a new era of prosperity. It is now up to us to decide – shall we unite the land of the Swahilis under a single flag?"
