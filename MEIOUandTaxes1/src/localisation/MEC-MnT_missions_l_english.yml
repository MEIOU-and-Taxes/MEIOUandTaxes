 ### French Missions:
 fra_centralise_state_title: "Centralise State"
 fra_centralise_state_desc: "France was a very decentralised state during the Middle Ages. At the time, Lorraine and Provence were states of the Holy Roman Empire and not a part of France. North of the Loire, the King of France at times fought or allied with one of the great principalities of Normandy, Anjou, Blois-Champagne, Flanders and Burgundy. The duke of Normandy was overlord of the duke of Brittany. South of the Loire were the principalities of Aquitaine, Toulouse and Barcelona. Normandy became the strongest power in the north, while Barcelona became the strongest in the south. The rulers of both fiefs eventually became kings, the former by the conquest of England, and the latter by the succession to Aragon. French suzerainty over Barcelona was only formally relinquished by Saint Louis in 1258."

 fra_annex_loire_vallee_desc: "In the  Middle Ages, the Loire Valley was the scene of almost continuous struggles from the 10th to the 15th century. They first concern the succession to the crown of England, then the struggle between Capetians and Plantagenets for the possession of the Kingdom of France. The end of the so-called Hundred Years War in 1450 marked the beginning of a new era for the Loire Valley, Charles VII and Louis XI ordering or allowing the construction of what would later be called the Châteaux de la Loire. \nThe Renaissance sees the apogee of the role of the Loire Valley within the Kingdom of France. From Charles VII and Louis XI, who made Tours the capital, until Henri IV who brought it back to Paris in 1594, the center of power remained in the region. The Valois, who discovered a new aesthetic and a new way of life in Italy, never stopped transposing them to the Loire Valley, bringing in many Italian artists and craftsmen, including the most famous of them , Leonardo da Vinci. Thus was born what would later be called the first French Renaissance, during which the royal castles of Amboise and Blois, or built, by the king himself or great lords, "court castles" intended for pleasure, such as that of Chambord by François I, or that of Montsoreau by Jean II de Chambes."
 fra_reconquer_normandie_title: "Reconquer Normandie"
 fra_reconquer_normandie_desc: "Normandy played an important role during the Hundred Years' War , which stretched from 1337 to 1453. If it was not at the origin of the conflict, it quickly became an issue between the King of England and the King of France . The wealth of Normandy , its common past with the English (before 1204, the Duchy of Normandy and the Kingdom of England had the same master) and its geographical proximity to the island explain this particular situation. \nTwo periods emerge in this war: at first, the intervention of the English is episodic since they are content to launch destructive rides through the region. However, a powerful Norman lord, Charles the Bad , by rallying to the English, ignited a civil war which pitted the Normans against each other. \nIn a second time, the English presence is much heavier since they occupy the region for more than three decades, between 1417 and 1450. In 1420, the Treaty of Troyes makes the King of England the heir to the kingdom of France. Normandy then appears as the central element of English France. Finally, the king of France Charles  VII reconquers the rich province and forgives the Normans who collaborated with the enemy. Normandy regains peace but emerges very weakened from the conflict."
 fra_subjugate_bretagne_title: "Subjugate Brittany"
 fra_subjugate_bretagne_desc: "The Treaty of Guérande in 1365 which ended the Breton Succession War, however, stated that in the absence of a male heir from the House of Montfort, the heirs of Joanna of Penthièvre would succeed. By the time Anne was born, her father Francis II was the only male from the Breton House of Montfort, and the Blois-Penthièvre heir was a female, Nicole of Blois, who in 1480 sold her rights over Brittany to King Louis XI of France for the amount of 50,000 écus. In 1488, Francis II was defeated at the Battle of Saint-Aubin-du-Cormier, ending the Mad War (la Guerre Folle) between Brittany and France. In the Treaty of Sablé (19 August 1488), which concluded the peace settlement, the Duke was forced to accept clauses stipulating that his daughters were not to marry without the approval of the King of France. With the death of Francis II soon afterwards (9 September 1488) as a result of a fall from his horse, Brittany was plunged into a fresh crisis, leading to the final Franco-Breton war. On his deathbed, the Duke made his daughter promise never to consent to the subjugation of the Duchy to the Kingdom of France. Anne married Maximillian of Austria by proxy on 19 December 1490, but this is a serious provocation—it not only violated the Treaty of Sablé (the King of France not having consented to the marriage). So Charles VIII invaded Brittany in the spring of 1491 and laid siege to Rennes where Anne stayed. Without any spanish or austrian helps, Anne had no choice but to marry Charles VIII."

 fra_conquer_bourgogne_desc: "Mary assumed the rule of her father Charles the Bold's domains upon his defeat in battle and death on 5 January 1477. King Louis XI of France seized the opportunity to attempt to take possession of the Duchy of Burgundy proper and also the regions of Franche-Comté, Picardy and Artois. The king was anxious that Mary should marry his son Charles and thus secure the inheritance of the Low Countries for his heirs, by force of arms if necessary. Burgundy, fearing French military power, sent an embassy to France to negotiate a marriage between Mary and the six-year-old Dauphin (later King Charles VIII)"
 fra_conquer_lorraine_title: "Control Lorraine"
 fra_conquer_lorraine_desc: "The border between the Empire and the Kingdom of France remained relatively stable throughout the Middle Ages. In 1301, Count Henry III of Bar had to receive the western part of his lands (Barrois mouvant) as a fief by King Philip IV of France. In 1475, the Burgundian duke Charles the Bold campaigned for the Duchy of Lorraine, but was finally defeated and killed at the 1477 Battle of Nancy. In the 1552 Treaty of Chambord, a number of insurgent Protestant Imperial princes around Elector Maurice of Saxony ceded the Three Bishoprics to King Henry II of France in turn for his support. Due to the weakening of Imperial authority during the 1618-1648 Thirty Years' War, France was able to occupy the duchy in 1634 and retained it until 1661 when Charles IV was restored. In 1670, the French invaded again, forcing Charles into exile; his nephew and heir Charles V (1643-1690) spent his life in the service of the Imperial House of Habsburg. France returned the Duchy in the 1697 Treaty of Ryswick ending the Nine Years' War and Charles' son Leopold (1679-1729), became duke and was known as 'Leopold the Good;' in the 1701-1714 War of the Spanish Succession, parts of Lorraine, including the capital Nancy, were again occupied by France, but Leopold continued to reign at the Château de Lunéville. In 1737, after the War of the Polish Succession, an agreement between France, the Habsburgs and the Lorraine House of Vaudémont assigned the Duchy to Stanisław Leszczynski, former king of Poland. He was also father-in-law to King Louis XV of France, who lost out to a candidate backed by Russia and Austria in the War of the Polish Succession. The Lorraine duke Francis Stephen, betrothed to the Emperor's daughter Archduchess Maria Theresa, was compensated with the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, where the last Medici ruler had recently died without issue. France also promised to support Maria Theresa as heir to the Habsburg possessions under the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713. Leszczynski received Lorraine with the understanding that it would fall to the French crown on his death. When Stanisław died on 23 February 1766, Lorraine was annexed by France."

Beset by enemies and seeking to gain a free hand in Hungary, the Habsburgs sold their Sundgau territory (mostly in Upper Alsace) to France in 1646, which had occupied it, for the sum of 1.2 million Thalers. When hostilities were concluded in 1648 with the Treaty of Westphalia, most of Alsace was recognized as part of France, although some towns remained independent. "

 fra_reconquer_saintonge_desc: "The region fell under the control of the kings and dukes of Aquitaine, the counts of Anjou, then the counts of Poitiers, before becoming integrated for centuries in the new Duchy of Aquitaine. Occupying the frontier between Capetian and Plantagenet-controlled areas during the late Middle Ages, between 1152 and 1451, it was the site of constant struggles between lords torn between their allegiance to Anglo-Aquitaine and those linked to Paris. Saintonge was primarily attached to Anglo-Aquitaine until the mid-fourteenth century. However, errors by Henry of Grosmont, 1st Duke of Lancaster and Edward, the Black Prince gradually contributed to weakening English power, and the province ultimately came under the control of the King of France, Charles VII, 'the Victorious', in 1453"
 fra_reconquer_guyenne_title: "Reconquer Aquitaine"
 fra_reconquer_guyenne_desc: "In 1337, King Philip VI of France reclaimed the fief of Aquitaine (essentially corresponding to Gascony) from Edward III of England. Edward in turn claimed the entire Kingdom of France as the only grandson of King Philip IV of France. This triggered the Hundred Years' War, in which both the Plantagenets and the House of Valois claimed the supremacy over Aquitaine. In 1360, both sides signed the Treaty of Bretigny, in which Edward renounced the French crown but remained sovereign Lord of Aquitaine (rather than merely duke). \nHowever, when the treaty was broken in 1369, both these English claims and the war resumed. French victory was complete with the Battle of Castillon of 1453. England and France nominally remained at war for another 20 years, but England was in no position to continue its campaign, due to its escalating internal conflicts. The Hundred Years' War was formally concluded with the Treaty of Picquigny of 1475. With the end of the Hundred Years' War, Aquitaine returned under direct rule of the king of France and remained in the possession of the king."

He succeeded his father as Count of Maine, Guise, Mortain and Gien in 1472. He succeeded his uncle René I of Naples in 1480 as forth Duke of Anjou and Count of Provence, according to the will of René who had no surviving son. René's surviving daughter Yolande received Bar and was already Duchess of Lorraine. He also used the title of Duke of Calabria, in token of the claims to Naples he inherited from René. He willed his inheritance to his cousin Louis XI of France, whose heirs thus obtained a claim to the affairs of Italy, pursued in the next decades."

The death of his uncle Bernabò in 1385 left Gian Galeazzo as the sole ruler over the Visconti inheritance, and with this Valentina's status changed considerably. Gian Galeazzo eventually chose Louis, Duke of Touraine (later Duke of Orléans), second son of King Charles V of France and brother of the reigning Charles VI. \nValentina received as a dowry the County of Vertus (which was the dowry of her own mother at the time of her marriage in 1348) and the city of Asti, with the sums of 450,000 florins in cash and 75,000 florins in jewelry. In the marriage contract was also stipulated that in absence of male heirs, Valentina would inherit the Visconti dominions. It was because of this, that her grandson Louis XII of France claimed the Duchy of Milan and embarked on the Italian Wars. "

Normally this would be seen as a very weak claim but due to the impopularity of the Neapolitan rulers and the support from Curia, this might be overlooked."

Now even the core of the Empire, Asia Minor and Greece have been lost to invaders.\nMost of Makedonia, held by the Serbian 'Empire'.\nThe Duchy of Athens, lost after the Sack of Constantinople, in Personal Union with the Crown of Aragon.\nThe Principality of Achaia, likewise lost after the Sack of Constantinople.\nThe Despotate of Morea, technically Roman, but held by the disloyal Kantakouzenos.\nVenetian holdings in Morea and Thessalia, gained after their godless 'Crusaders' sacked The City.\n\nWe must recover the core of our empire in the west and drive out the Latins and the Slavs, for Rhomania!"
 byz_recover_albania_title: "Annex Albania"
 byz_recover_albania_desc: "The tribes of Albania have held their independence since the devastation of the Fourth Crusade, standing in open defiance of Rhomania. The time has come to remind them of the totality of our rule."
 byz_recover_serbia_title: "Suppress Serbia"
 byz_recover_serbia_desc: "The lands beyond Greece had once been unified under the Serbs, yet now the polity falls to ruin. The deterioration and decentralisation of the Serbs provides us with a newfound opportunity, to restore Serbia to Roman rule once more."
 byz_recover_illyria_title: "Regain Illyría"
 byz_recover_illyria_desc: "The Adriatic was once the dividing line of the Empire, yet it was lost to Schismatics in the twelfth century. Regaining it would extend Roman power into the heart of Europe and bring Italy back into our sphere of influence."
 byz_destroy_venice_title: "Destroy Venice"
 byz_destroy_venice_desc: "The Fourth Crusade was the darkest hour of our Empire, subjecting the Roman people to milenia of foreign domination. Under the direction of the Venetian devils, our Empire suffered a humiliating defeat. No longer will we bear this shame. It is time for Venice to pay for its treachery, and face the wrath of Rome. All will remember the day that Rome came to Venice."
 byz_recover_sicily_title: "Subjugate Sicily"
 byz_recover_sicily_desc: "Lost to an Arab invasion in the tenth century, Sicily has long remained the gateway to further invasions of Africa and beyond. Reclaiming the island would provide us both an incredible staging point, and a long-time breadbasket."
 byz_recover_tunis_title: "Reconquer Africa"
 byz_recover_tunis_desc: "Centred on Carthage, the Exarchate of Africa resisted the Arab invasion for two generations before it too was lost to Rome. Its passing was a sad fate for the city that once rivalled the empire itself. Let us restore this province to Roman rule."
 byz_recover_mauretania_title: "Acquire Mauretania"
 byz_recover_mauretania_desc: "The raids of the Barbary Corsairs have long originated from their safe ports along the coast of Mauretania. Reconquering the province would remove one of the last obstacles to domination of the Mediterranean."
 
 byz_restore_konstantinoupolis_title: "Restore The City"
 byz_restore_konstantinoupolis_desc: "Once the Queen of Cities, Constantinople no longer commands the world's attention. Years of mismanagement and financial hardship have left the city in poor shape. For Rome to truly rise once more, the heart of the Empire must be restored to glory."
 byz_recover_bulgaria_title: "Crush Bulgaria"
 byz_recover_bulgaria_desc: "When the Bulgars revolted in 1186, they seized land tantalizingly close to Constantinople itself. Without that buffer in the north, the Emperor was constantly distracted by northern barbarians at times when he was most needed elsewhere.  Let our ruler claim once again the title of Bulgar-Slayer."
 byz_foothold_in_italy_title: "Italian Foothold"
 byz_foothold_in_italy_desc: "The eastern islands of the Adriatic were lost in the thirteenth century. Recovering those islands would not only protect the capital, it would also open the door to the recovery of Italy and the Western Empire."
 byz_recover_naples_title: "Smash Naples"
 byz_recover_naples_desc: "The boot of Italy remained Roman long after the fall of Rome. Lost to the Normans in the eleventh century, Bari was a bastion of the Orthodox faith and Greek culture in Western Europe. It is time for Naples to remember this."
 byz_recover_rome_title: "Recover Rome"

 byz_recover_west_islands_title: "Western Islands"
 byz_recover_west_islands_desc: "The islands of the West were key to controlling the Mediterranean trade, yet they were lost to the Arabs one by one until the last fort in Syracuse fell in the tenth century. With them in our possession, we might dream of extending our rule to Africa and Spania once more..."
 byz_recover_south_spain_title: "Iberian Foothold"
 byz_recover_south_spain_desc: "Justinian's most ambitious conquest was to regain the province of Spania for Rome. Alas, it did not survive even a century against the Visigoths - but how grand, to dream of it!"
 byz_recover_spain_title: "Seize Iberia"
 byz_recover_spain_desc: "Justinain's dream is no longer just that, a dream. It is time for us to move past the shadow of Justinian, and reconquer all of Spania."
 byz_recover_britannia_title: "Obliterate Britannia"
 byz_recover_britannia_desc: "The rebel province of Britannia lies beyond the so called 'English Channel'. It is time to restore these distant isles to the fold. Let us mobilise the grand fleet of Rome, and crush these rebels once and for all."

 byz_recover_east_islands_title: "Recover the Aegean"
 byz_recover_east_islands_desc: "The Greek islands of the Mediterranean were wrested from our hands by the thirteenth century, and even now suffer under the yoke of heretics and heathens. Regain them, and we have the footing we need to take back the Levant and Egypt."
 byz_recover_tripoli_title: "Acquire Tripolitania"
 byz_recover_tripoli_desc: "Regained from the Vandals, Tripolitania was lost just as suddenly to the Arabs. It has been part of the Muslim world since the seventh century. No longer."
 byz_recover_antioch_title: "The Cradle of Christianity"
 byz_recover_antioch_desc: "Long has the Patriarch of Antioch endured the rule of heathen conquerors, far from the light of Konstantinoupolis. With Kilikia secure, our chance to secure the ancient city has come. Let us recover Antioch once and for all!"
 byz_recover_jerusalem_title: "Reconquer the Holy City"
 byz_recover_jerusalem_desc: "Jerusalem is the holiest site in all Christendom - and we lost it in the seventh century. We can only expunge this shame by recovering it for the empire, restoring the Patriarch to this throne and rededicating its churches to the one true God!"
 byz_recover_egypt_title: "Reconquer Egypt"
 byz_recover_egypt_desc: "Once the breadbasket of the empire, Egypt's loss was devastating for the empire. Despite many attempts, it was never regained for Constantinople...until now."
 byz_recover_central_italy_title: "Control Central Italy"
 byz_recover_central_italy_desc: "Made the capital of the Empire for its forbidding location, Ravenna held out against the Lombards until the eigth century. With the lands of centre of Italy in Roman hands, Rome's safely can be assured once more."
 byz_recover_north_italy_title: "Conquer Lombardia"
 byz_recover_north_italy_desc: "Not since the days of the united Empire has Rome held the Po Valley in its grasp. It is time to conquer the last region of Italy that stands in defiance of Rome, and the realisation of our destiny."
 byz_recover_france_title: "Regain Gaul"
 byz_recover_france_desc: "The time for dreaming of long-lost lands is over. Beyond the Alpes, beyond the Pyrenees lies the polities of Francia, heir to the people of Gaul, to Romans. No more false kings, no more pretenders. The wait is over. Rome is here, and its people will once more join us under the sun."
 byz_to_the_rhine_and_danube_title: "To the Rhine and Danube"
 byz_to_the_rhine_and_danube_desc: "The German invaders have long held the lands along the great rivers of the Rhine, and the Danube. Here lies our final challenge to Roman territorial integrity, the last rebels within our borders. Let us march once more to the river's shores, and restore the last borders of Rome."
 
 byz_stabilize_the_empire_title: "Stabilise the Empire"
 byz_stabilize_the_empire_desc: "The dream of Imperial Reconquest lies at the very heart of the Roman people. To achieve such an ambitious goal, we must rise above the instability and chaos of recent times. Rome must rise once more, stronger, united and absolute in its will to reclaim what is rightfully ours."
 byz_recover_west_anatolia_title: "Reclaim the Propontis"
 byz_recover_west_anatolia_desc: "Rome will never be safe while the Bosphorus lies in enemy hands. Many across the sea are still loyal to Rome, and yearn for the return of Roman rule. Let us drive the enemy from our door and begin our dream of a Roman lake once more."
 byz_reclaim_the_ionian_coast_title: "Seize the Ioanian Coast"
 byz_reclaim_the_ionian_coast_desc: "The Beyliks of the west have plagued the seas for too long, raiding our shores with impunity. While their sailors may be fierce, the coast long has been disunited, marred by disagreements and divided by the split loyalties of their Roman subjects. Let us march forward and liberate our people once more."
 byz_advancing_inland_title: "Advancing Inland"
 byz_advancing_inland_desc: "The security of our borders is frustrated by the lack of defence-in-depth, the absence of territory that provides a buffer between us and aspiring raiders. The frontier must be driven forward, into the highlands of Osman's Turks."
 byz_recover_central_anatolia_title: "The Anatolian Frontier"
 byz_recover_central_anatolia_desc: "Beyond our borders lies the Anatolian Frontier, a land of upstart Beyliks that have long threatened the empire's security. We must begin the expansion of our borders, beyond the minor Beyliks to confront the powers of the Central Plateau."
 byz_recover_eastern_anatolia_title: "The Seljuk Successors"
 byz_recover_eastern_anatolia_desc: "Before the time of the Ottomans, our greatest enemy was the Sultanate of Rum, a power that still holds sway through its remnant states on the Anatolian Plateau. If we are to secure Anatolia we must confront the eastern powers, and seize control of our ancient cities once more."
 byz_recover_south_anatolia_title: "Forward unto Kilikia"
 byz_recover_south_anatolia_desc: "Our recent conquests have restored ancient dreams of Universal Empire, aspirations that may very well exceed our current capacity. Even so, our generals have sent scouts to the southern coast, in anticipation of future conquests. The lands of Kilikia still harbour many Christians, and the coast remains an important trade entrepot. The road to Kilikia must be secured."
 byz_armenian_highlands_title: "The Armenian Highlands"
 byz_armenian_highlands_desc: "In a single day at Manzikert half of Asia Minor fell to the Turks. What was once a loyal Theme of the empire became little more than a nightmare. It is time for its residents to wake up to a new day of Roman rule."
 byz_recover_trebizond_title: "Depose Trebizond"
 byz_recover_trebizond_desc: "The Fourth Crusade was devastating for the fragile Empire. Although parts of the Empire remained in Greek hands, the Pontic coast was never regained for Constantinople. It is time to crush the false pretender, and restore the coast to Roman rule."
 byz_recover_crimea_title: "Across the Black Sea"
 byz_recover_crimea_desc: "Constantinople should rightfully command all the trade from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean, but Italian interests and rebels forced her to destitution.  Bringing our soldiers to the shores of the Crimea will once more reaffirm our status as a trading power."
 byz_the_pentarchy_title: "The Pentarchy"
 byz_the_pentarchy_desc: "The Great Schism has long left Christianity divided, fuelled by the loss of the great seats of Antiquity. If we could restore Roman control over all five seats, perhaps we could end the Schism once and for all."
 byz_restore_rome_to_glory_title: "Restore Rome to Glory"
 byz_restore_rome_to_glory_desc: "The Rome of Antiquity was a glorious city, the envy of the world. All roads led to a city of over a million people, sustained through the secure grain trade of the Mediterranean. With Rome once more in Roman hands, we have an opportunity to rebuild the city with newfound glory for all to behold."
 byz_depose_false_emperor_title: "Depose the False Emperor"
 byz_depose_false_emperor_desc: "As the Reconquest continues, a pressing issue has arisen. While our triumphs are many, the continued existence of the False Emperor leaves a potential challenger to the absolution of Roman rule. We must bear this insult no longer."

Now our people feel a growing sense of nationhood, no longer looking to individual rulers and petty states. Instead they hope for a single nation, strong, unified, and leading the way into a new era of prosperity. It is now up to us to decide – shall we unite the land of the Swahilis under a single flag?"
