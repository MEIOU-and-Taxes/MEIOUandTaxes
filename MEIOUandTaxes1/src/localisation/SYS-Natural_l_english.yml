Jump_Definition: "§OJumping a Node§!: It is the action where a Sector can reach another Node which is not a direct neighbour. If we have Nodes §T'A-B-C'§!, §TA§! would reach §TC§! through §TB§!. Majors can do it once, while Dominants can do it twice. For example if §TA-B-C-D§!, a Dominant could reach §TD§! directly if they own in §TB§! and §TC§!. In the first "jump", Sectors can trade with Important, Majors or Dominants, while in the second jump (the last possible) can only trade with Majors or Dominants."
