 french_wars_of_religion.1.d.catholic: "Over time, unceasing discrimination against the Protestants of France has led to increasing factionalism among the French nobility, of whom roughly half are now Protestants. The Catholic faction of French nobles is led by the Duke of Guise, while the Prince of Condé leads the Protestants, who have become known as the Huguenots.\n\nPromising the liberation of $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ from evil and corrupt ministers, a group of Protestant nobles led by the Prince of Condé have issued a call to arms, declaring a sort of protectorate over the Protestant churches throughout France. Protestants have seized control of numerous cities throughout France, demolishing Catholic institutions in the process. The Crown has yet to choose a side in a sectarian conflict that may yet tear the nation apart."

This policy made official the persecution already enforced since the dragonnades created in 1681 by the king in order to intimidate Huguenots into converting to Catholicism. As a result of the officially sanctioned persecution by the dragoons who were billeted upon prominent Huguenots, a large number of Protestants — estimates range from 210,000 to 900,000 — left France over the next two decades."
