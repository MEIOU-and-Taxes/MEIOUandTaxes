 DG_Orthodox.002.title: "Monasticism"
 DG_Orthodox.002.desc: "Orthodox monks followed the example of St. Anthony, living detached from their fellow man to better contemplate God.\n\nThe §GAnchoritic life§! is one of the earliest forms of Christian monasticism. Anchorite monks lived alone, scratching out an ascetic existence in the wilderness in order to devote themselves entirely to God. Unlike hermits, they were required to take a vow of stability of place, opting for permanent enclosure in cells often attached to churches. Also unlike hermits, anchorites were subject to a religious rite of consecration that closely resembled the funeral rite.\n\n§GCenobitic monasticism§! is a monastic tradition that stresses community life. The life of the cenobitic monk is regulated by a religious rule, a collection of precepts. Cenobites lived together in monasteries, farming and praying together. These communities ironically formed the nucleus of small towns as peasants sought to colonise new land nearby.\n\nA §GLavra§! is a type of monastery, in between an anchorite monasterry and a cenobite monastery, consisting of a cluster of cells or caves for hermits, with a church and sometimes a refectory at the center. Lavras controlled vast swaths of land and used their wealth to act as charities.\n\n Finally, §GStravropegic§! monasteries were monasteries under the personal jurisdiction of the patriarch and represented the basis of his power.\n\nThe question is what we want for our province..."

 DG_Orthodox.003.title: "Holy Fool"
 DG_Orthodox.003.desc: "A holy fool has emerged in $PROVINCENAME$, shocking the locals with his antics.\n\nA particularly distinctive aspect of Orthodox Christianity is its veneration of holy fools - pious monks who acted erratically. Holy Fools such as Symeon the New Theologian, Ioann Big Cap, or Basil the Blessed shocked society with their antics: walking around naked, throwing nuts at women during services, carrying around dead animals, insulting the people they met - and more heretical deeds, such as idolizing their teachers or, in so doing, they mocked the rule-bound, solemn Orthodox religion. But rather than be condemned by the church, holy fools were considered to be sacred. In mocking society, they gave critics an outlet for their frustration and so reinforced the rules they detested. Some holy fools became famous and beloved characters in $COUNTRY_ADJ$ history. Others ended up being condemned for heresy."

 DG_Orthodox.004.desc: "Monasteries were often founded in the deepest wilderness as a way to enjoy splendid isolation that would allow monks to devote themselves to God without allowing the sins of the world to interfere. As a self-sufficient community, monasteries ended up farming this marginal land, proving to others that it was usable. Peasants would often settle near monasteries, creating busy towns around the once quiet monasteries."

 DG_Orthodox.005.title: "The Metropolitan of $PROVINCECAPITAL$"
 DG_Orthodox.005.desc: "The Orthodox Church was divided into areas that were under of the administration of a Metropolitan, who in turn was under the Patriarch. The Metropolitan of $PROVINCECAPITAL$ is in charge of $PROVINCECULTURE$ priests and monks and so has a great deal of influence.

 DG_Orthodox.901.desc: "The Virgin Mary was especially venerated by Christians as a protector against the Adversary and his demons in Hell as well as against temporal enemies on Earth. Especially among Eastern Orthodox Christians, when an invading army was turned away it was sometimes attributed to Mary interceding on behalf of the defenders. Icons of her such as Our Lady of Vlahern Church in Constantinople and Our Lady of Vladimir in Moscow were said to bless those cities, protecting them from invaders. During sieges, priests would parade the icons around the battlements in order to cheer the defenders on and ward off evil."

One of the roles of such elders was to receive visitors from afar, offering advice, confession and blessings to them.\n\nUpon visiting the elder, the $MONARCHTITLE$ spent some time conversing with him, then asked him to pray for him.

One of the roles of such elders was to receive visitors from afar, offering advice, confession and blessings to them, but since they were independent of the church, they could be full of surprises.\n\nUpon visiting the elder, the $MONARCHTITLE$ was confronted with an angry old man who berated $MONARCH$ for a long litany of sins."

A saint was a sign of God's favour, and a source of great joy."

 DG_Orthodox.007.title: "The Non-Possessor Movement"
 DG_Orthodox.007.desc: "With the end of the Orthodox kalendar millennium in 1492, Orthodox Christians felt a renewed connection to God. Many new churches and monasteries were founded; at the same time, many people noticed with unease how wealthy the church was becoming. Two opposing movements emerged: Non-Possessors believed that purity of heart was more important than knowledge of the liturgy and condemned the growing power of the monasteries. Possessors believed that monasteries were centres of learning and prayer, and encouraged more to be built. Both sides claimed prominent monks, and despite their differences, agreed on most issues of doctrine.\n\nAlthough the Non-Possessor movement had many supporters among the peasants, the Possessor movement was more popular with royalty. Endowing monasteries was a traditional way for a ruler to show his piety, and monasteries spread a message of loyalty to the ruler. While some princes supported the Non-Possessors, perhaps as a pretext to seizing land from the church, but most agreed to persecute them."

 DG_Orthodox.008.title: "The Judaizer Heresy"
 DG_Orthodox.008.desc: "With the fall of Rome, Orthodox Christianity went through a process of spiritual renewal while simultaneously becoming defensive, seeking to reform by becoming closer to the past church. This inspired a movement called the Judaizer heresy. Proponents believed that the Trinity was a false doctrine that had crept into the church, opposed the veneration of icons as idolatry, and condemned monks for their greed. The movement intensified with the Lutheran Reformation in the West, as Orthodox Christians witnessed the systematic dismantling of monasteries there. Although some rulers supported the Judaizers, probably as a weapon against the church, most were alarmed by it and agreed to persecute it."

 DG_Orthodox.012.title: "Holy Icon Destroyed"
 DG_Orthodox.012.desc: "With the sack of $PROVINCECAPITAL$, many $COUNTRY_RELIGION$ churches were looted or burned. Priceless reliquaries, icons, and bibles were stolen, desecrated or destroyed - among them, the famous icon of Our Lady of $PROVINCECAPITAL$. This loss has struck a grave blow against $COUNTRY$, but at the same time it has made our men eager to take vengeance!"

 DG_Orthodox.014.title: "The Monastery of St. Catherine"
 DG_Orthodox.014.desc: "We have rediscovered the Monastery of St. Catherine. Built in the first centuries of Christianity, it was one of the most important Byzantine monasteries, but was lost to the Orthodox world when it was conquered by the Arabs and gradually abandoned. The desert climate preserved the monastery and its contents. When it was rediscovered in $YEAR$, it contained a large collection of early Byzantine icons - some of the only ones to have escaped the Iconoclast purges of the eigth century. This incredible find will surely reinvigorate the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ church!"
 DG_Orthodox.014.opta: "Bring the icons back to $CAPITAL_CITY$"
 DG_Orthodox.015.title: "The Monks of Mount Athos"
 DG_Orthodox.015.desc: "In the tenth century a series of 'holy mountain' monasteries were established by the Byzantine empire. The most successful of these was Mt. Athos, established in $PROVINCENAME$ in 963. Beginning as a Great Lavras, it quickly expanded as other monks speaking other languages arrived at the mountain and built their own monasteries, until it became a community of Orthodox monks. This allowed them to share ideas and prayers, contributing greatly to Orthodox doctrine. After the battle of Manzikert, it was left as the only remaining holy mountain, a site of pilgrimages and hermitages. Despite its importance, Mt. Athos was a small community that didn't bother anyone, and conquerors often found it more expedient to let the monks continue to live their lives than bother to disperse them."

The two men discovered that they shared much in common, including an intense dislike of the Catholic church. Eagerly, $DIPLOMAT$ introduced the patriarch to a $COUNTRY_RELIGION$ cleric in $CAPITAL_CITY$, and they struck up a long-distance correspondence, eagerly discussing the concept of a united front against the Catholics.

 DG_Orthodox.017.desc: "The Orthodox Patriarch of $PROVINCECAPITAL$ has been making enemies in his own church recently. While on a journey abroad, it seems he took a liking to tenets normally associated with other Christian denominations: the ideas of predestination and salvation through faith alone. Now he is publishing a 'Confession of Faith' with these ideas, horrifying some of his own churchmen. The Catholic Jesuits appear to be equally horrified, and have quietly offered us a bribe if we will agree to execute him and replace him with a more Orthodox patriarch."

 DG_Orthodox.018.title: "The Castrated Ones"
 DG_Orthodox.018.desc: "Orthodox Christianity had always had a strong belief in the Last Judgement. At times, millennarial sects rose up, fuelled by the idea that the End Times were coming. One of the most memorable of these was a sect led by an uneducated peasant who misunderstood certain words in the bible, mixing up 'Redeemer' for 'Castrator' and 'Be fruitful' with 'Castrate yourselves'. Gaining a surprisingly large number of followers, he exhorted Christians to cut off their genitals (women cut off their breasts instead) to achieve purity."

It encouraged Christians to embrace stillness and a mystical relationship with God, versus their rationalist opponents.

The emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire enjoyed a particular sanctity in the church, as did any successor who could claim to have his authority. At the same time, church history taught that, in his last days, Constantine the Great signed over the empire to the Patriarch of Rome, recorded in the Donation of Constantine. When these two ideas were combined, it could be interpreted that the Patriarch should be superior to the $MONARCHTITLE$.\n\nSaying this about the church was scandal enough, but the Patriarch is going even farther: he maintains that the Patriarch should be superior to the $MONARCHTITLE$ even in secular authority and riches!

Much of it was designed to be celebratory without much connection to Christ.\n\nThe Patriarch has called on the church to discard these practises, encouraging priests to smash tambourines and masks and abduct dancing bears.

In order to implement these reforms, the Patriarch has begun appointing only monks trained in the Greek liturgy to positions of authority in the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ church. This has resulted in opposition from within the church, both because it passes up monks who might otherwise make good administrators, and because monks trained in the Greek fashion are more likely to be tainted by contact with heresy."

In contrast, bishops were nearly always chosen from the ranks of the highly educated and often wealthy monks. This created resentment of the monks by the whites and derision of the priests by the blacks.\n\nTo heal this division in the church, the Patriarch has proposed that the $MONARCHTITLE$ sponsor nation-wide seminaries and require all children of priests to attend clerical training in order to be better prepared for their future careers."

The original split between Orthodox and Oriental was exacerbated by this difference, since the word 'nature' so key to understanding the two is slightly different in Oriental than it is in Greek. Having a shared language would prevent this sort of problem from happening again.

However, the Orientals felt that the Orthodox church was flirting with heresy when it failed to condemn three church leaders who had supported Nestorius - although in at least two cases, due in large part to translation errors. The Orthodox church later agreed to do so in an attempt to reunite the churches in 544, only to suffer schism anew as several bishops left the church over the issue. The problem was that by condemning these men for this single issue it also condemned their support of the Council of Chalcedon - and laid open the possibility of condemning saints who had been mistaken about other topics. Yet by approving their words, it meant tacitly approving heresy.\n\nWith the blessing of the $MONARCHTITLE$, Patriarch $THEOLOGIAN$ has answered this thorny question by saying:"

At the Council of Chalcedon the early church attempted to lay the issue at rest when they declared that Jesus had two natures - divine and mortal - that were united in a single essence. This contradicted the ideas of Nestorius, the patriarch of Constantinople who claimed that Jesus was born human and become divine afterwards.\n\nBoth Orthodox and Oriental Christians rejected the Monophysite ideas of Nestorius, but they nevertheless disagreed with each other. Orientals claimed that Jesus had one nature - both divine and human - while Orthodox Christians claimed that he had two natures - fully divine and fully human at the same time, unchanging and undivided. While the two sides were not opposites, there was enough difference that it became the cornerstone of the Oriental church's opposition to the Orthodox church. When the Romans attempted to heal the schism with the Act of Union, they deliberately criticised the Nestorians while trying to bridge the two views, declaring that Christ had two natures but one will, a view called Monothelite. That opinion was abandoned after Egypt and Syria were lost.\n\nWith the blessing of the $MONARCHTITLE$, Patriarch $THEOLOGIAN$ has answered this thorny question by saying:"

With our ruler as the head of the church, it has become possible for us to convert to this Assyrian Christianity by recognising the Patriarch of Assyria as the true head of the church."
 convert_to_miaphysite_title: "§G†§! Follow the Patriarchs of Alexandria and Antioch"
 convert_to_miaphysite_desc: "Having the Patriarch of Alexandria or Antioch under our control gives Christians in our lands someone to turn to other than our official leaders overseas. With our ruler as the head of the church, it has become possible for us to convert to this Oriental Christianity by recognising a Patriarch as the true head of the church."
 divorce_spouse_title: "§G†§! Divorce our spouse"
 divorce_spouse_desc: "With our ruler's marriage being fruitless, there are those in government who believe the problem lies in barrenness. In order for the realm to be made secure, an heir must be produced - even if it means divorce."
 make_donation_of_constantine_title: "§G†§! Donate a province to host the papacy"
 make_donation_of_constantine_desc: "Although we have a strong connection with the pope, he is too far away to properly influence or protect. By assigning a fief to him, we could ensure that he would be safe from enemies - and that our cardinals would be in place during papal conclaves."
 england_marriage_bohemia_title: "Strategic marriage with Bohemia"
 england_marriage_bohemia_desc: "It would be to the benefit of house $DYNASTY$ to form a dynastic marriage with Bohemia, a powerful nation that has dissimilar strategic aims."
 evangelical_union_title: "§G†§! Establish the $PRIMARY_CULTURE$ Union of Churches"
 evangelical_union_desc: "Calvinist and Lutheran Christians lived side by side, but not always peacefully. Despite having much in common, the two churches were divided theologically and by their leadership. Many Lutheran rulers saw this division as wasteful and sought to bridge the gap between them, but all compromise failed. One solution remained: legally uniting them. Unlike Catholics, both Lutherans and Calvinist Christians recognised the authority of the state over them, so the state could enforce a single book of liturgy and prayer common to all Lutherans and appoint bishops to rule them. This would, in theory, bring all Lutherans into a single union. In reality, not all would join the new church, but enough would to make it worthwhile. (This will increase toleration of minorities of the other faith by +2)"
 heal_the_schism_pentarchy_title: "§G†§! Attempt to heal the Western Schism"
 heal_the_schism_pentarchy_desc: "By restoring the Pentarchy and appointing a proper Patriarch of Rome, we can be said to have ended the Great Schism - the dream of generations of faithful Christians. Let us send missionaries to all the Schismatics inviting them to end their heresy, receive baptism and pledge loyalty to the Patriarch!"
 henotikon_title: "§G†§! Attempt to heal the Eastern Schism"
 henotikon_desc: "The Oriental and Orthodox churches have been split since the fifth century, but the two faiths share much in common. The Romans tried twice to heal the schism only to face dissension from both churches each time, then lost control of the patriarchates. Can we really do better than Justinian?\n\nWe will need a brilliant theologian, a determined ruler, the goodwill of both churches, a cooperative ecumenical patriarch, and the blessing of all five patriarchs to have even a chance of success."
 holy_synod_title: "§G†§! Establish a Holy Synod"
 holy_synod_desc: "Depending on his personality, a Patriarch can be a ruler's best friend or his most hated enemy. By establishing a permanent synod to rule the church, we can avoid having this issue. We will replace the Patriarch with a twelve member college presided over by a chief procurator appointed by the ruler. This will ensure that the church leadership will remain loyal, if uninspired."
 hundred_chapter_synod_title: "§G†§! Call the Hundred Chapter Synod"
 hundred_chapter_synod_desc: "We can summon all the bishops of our nation together to create a standardised church liturgy, proclaim the inviolability of church property and give church courts jurisdiction over their members. This will greatly strengthen the church in our country, giving them the power to convert heretics and heathens."
 independent_vatican_title: "§G†§! Root out foreign influence from the curia"
 independent_vatican_desc: "From time to time, popes were elected who saw the dangers of kings and emperors influencing papal elections. These popes worked to reduce the amount of influence that foreign rulers had over the curia, although this created resentment and their efforts were not always successful."
 miaphysite_ark_coronation_title: "§G†§! Be crowned by the Church"
 miaphysite_ark_coronation_desc: "The [Root.GetAdjective] Empire protected the Ark of the Covenant, brought from Israel to Axum in the fourth century and kept safe and secret at the Church of Our Lady of Zion in [ark_of_the_covenant.GetName]. Each monarch would make the journey to the isolated monastery to be crowned [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] by the monks who tended to the Ark. Ironically, not even [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] was permitted to view the Ark itself - only to be blessed by its watchers."
 miaphysite_commission_glory_of_kings_title: "§G†§! Commission a national religious epic"
 miaphysite_commission_glory_of_kings_desc: "Surrounded by powerful heathens and bereft of allies, our people are afraid. What they need is to draw strength from their isolation and their traditions, and our religious leaders may just have the solution in some Oriental texts they have found."
 miaphysite_disestablish_royal_church_title: "§G†§! Stop funding Royal Churches"
 miaphysite_disestablish_royal_church_desc: "Opulent Royal Churches funded by the state served to provide balance to the influence of monasteries and enhance the prestige of the royal family. Now that there is no need for this service, it is a waste of money that could better be spent elsewhere."
 miaphysite_expedition_title: "§G†§! Send an expedition to the King of the Spains"
 miaphysite_expedition_desc: "Rumour has it that in faraway Spain, the Christians there have taken the fight to the Muslims and driven them back! Perhaps such a powerful Christian ruler could become an ally in our fight for survival. We could send an expedition to make contact with these faraway Christians and hope they listen to our pleas."
 miaphysite_incorporate_monasteries_title: "§G†§! Incorporate the monasteries into the Church"
 miaphysite_incorporate_monasteries_desc: "With the Church too weak to convert heathens to Christianity, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] stepped in and made reforms. Monasteries were given more influence over the Church and fiefs of land ('gult') which allowed them to avoid hiring themselves out to local farmers to provide food for themselves. In return, the monasteries provided the Church with a needed supply of priests and maintained a library of religious books so that it could provide instruction to new priests. At the same time, the now wealthier monks were increasingly beholden to the state and less likely to criticise it."
 miaphysite_plant_royal_church_title: "§G†§! Plant a Royal Church"
 miaphysite_plant_royal_church_desc: "Most churches are run by monks who owe loyalty first to the Church and only second to the state. For this reason the state sometimes established opulent shrines that were staffed predominantly by canons rather than by monks in a process known as 'planting' (takkala). Royal churches rivalled the monasteries and their influence at court and helped spread the message that the kingship was sacred. Many rulers would be buried in these royal churches."
 miaphysite_relax_christian_rules_title: "§G†§! Relax rules for Christians"
 miaphysite_relax_christian_rules_desc: "The strict rules for Christians helped Christians to stand out and discouraged conversion to other faiths - but at the same time, it discouraged conversion to Christianity or even tolerance of other faiths. It may be in the best interests of the state to relax the rules."
 miaphysite_strict_christian_rules_title: "§G†§! Impose strict rules for Christians"
 miaphysite_strict_christian_rules_desc: "In order to encourage Christianity in [Root.GetName], the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] imposed harsh rules for Christians. Each was required to attend church on all Sabbath days, receiving communion only at the recommendation of their confessor. Every Christian was required to openly wear signs of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost on their foreheads and arms. Holy days and fasts were enforced by royal troops. Consulting with witch doctors, offering sacrifices to pagan gods and practising magic were all punishable by death. In this way the faith of the people stayed strong, even in adversity."
 offer_concordat_with_rome_title: "§G†§! Settle the question of Rome"
 offer_concordat_with_rome_desc: "The pope no longer rules in Rome, and efforts to restore him have failed. Perhaps it is time to offer a compromise and settle the issue once and for all?"
 patronato_real_title: "§G†§! Purchase control of the church overseas"
 patronato_real_desc: "The discovery of new lands overseas spurred dreams of converting untold millions to Christianity. The pope is willing to give us control of church lands in the colonies in return for church control over education in the colonies, the free passage of missionaries to convert the natives, and a portion of the income of church lands there."
 permanent_inquisition_title: "§G†§! Establish a state inquisition"
 permanent_inquisition_desc: "We could establish a permanent inquisition in our nation. Unlike medieval inquisitions, early modern inquisitions were an arm of the law and not beholden to the pope. Their goal was to root out heresy among Catholics, although sometimes they were used against heretics and heathens. In addition to fighting heresy, inquisitions investigated accusations of witchcraft, simony, blasphemy and other ecclesiastical crimes. Since a convicted heretic's property was given to his accuser, they were also used to settle scores and keep rivals in line, both by commoners and by the ruler. However, once begun, an inquisition could be hard to suppress."
 pragmatic_sanction_title: "§G†§! Declare independence from the Vatican"
 pragmatic_sanction_desc: "Unique among religions, the Catholic church maintained the special position of the pope as head of the church, regardless of nation or laws. As a result, the papacy meddled in local politics, from choosing bishops for benefices to demanding the first year's income (annate) from church estates to trying clergy under ecclesiastical law. By issuing a pragmatic sanction, we declare our belief in the supremacy of church councils, not the pope. This effectively makes our Catholic church independent by allowing clerics to be elected rather than appointed, banning the payment of annates, and limiting appeals to [the_vatican.GetCapitalName]. This puts the full power of the church into the hands of our ruler."
 promulgate_papal_constitution_title: "§G†§! Promulgate a constitution"
 promulgate_papal_constitution_desc: "The Papal States was a patchwork of cities that owed fealty to the pope. Each was run in a different manner, with differing traditions and powerful families dominating their politics. This could lead to the rise of despots and to breakaway cities. One solution to the problem was to write a constitution for the Papal States that would replace local laws with a single, unified code of laws. This was an effective weapon against nationalism and decentralisation - but it was also a threat to the power of the despots, some of whom had to be forced to comply."
 end_babylonian_captivity_title: "§G†§! End the Babylonian Captivity"
 end_babylonian_captivity_desc: "The Avignon Papacy was the period since 1309 during which several successive popes resided in Avignon. The increasing conflict between factions friendly and hostile to the Pope poses a threat to the Papal lands and to the allegiance of Rome itself. We need to move the Papal Court back to Rome and thrown down the French shackles."
 reconquer_papal_states_title: "§G†§! Reconquer the Papal States"
 reconquer_papal_states_desc: "The Papal States have slipped out of our direct control. We should concentrate our efforts on conquering these wayward vassals!"
 reconquer_papal_states_other_title: "§G†§! Seize a Province of the roman territorie"
 reconquer_papal_states_other_desc: "The roman territorie has slipped out of the control of the Pope and are now our Vassal."
 replace_patriarch_title: "§G†§! Replace the patriarch"
 replace_patriarch_desc: "As the Pontifex Maximus, our ruler is not only the head of state, but also head of the church. If a patriarch displeases him, he can be replaced. This will not endear the church to us, however."
 repudiate_miaphysite_agreement_title: "§G†§! Repudiate the Act of Union"
 repudiate_miaphysite_agreement_desc: "It is clear that the Act of Union is not enough to satisfy either the Orientals or the Orthodox church. As it stands, the act is bringing us trouble, not unity. Let us be rid of it and at least our own church will be happy!"
 request_annulment_title: "§G†§! Request annulment"
 request_annulment_desc: "Despite trying for some time, our ruler has failed to produce an heir. It might be time to seek an annulment!\n\nSince the Catholic Church does not permit divorce, someone wishing to dissolve their marriage has to seek an annulment instead - prove that the marriage had been invalid in the first place due to fraud, error, or the inability to produce children. Although it could be difficult to prove these, it could be done - especially when the resources of the government were applied to the case. When a monarch needed an annulment, it was up to the pope to decide.\n\nNote: If we have a royal marriage with another country, this may harm our relations with them."
 request_archbishopric_title: "§G†§! Request an archbishopric"
 request_archbishopric_desc: "The Church has not seen fit to grace us with an archbishop of our own. Surely his Holiness can be persuaded to appoint one for a nation as great as ours?"
 request_autocephaly_title: "§G†§! Request Autocephaly for our church"
 request_autocephaly_desc: "Our religious head is a Metropolitan, confirmed by the Patriarch rather than our ruler. A powerful ruler could take advantage of weaker Patriarchs by bribing them into agreeing to raise our Metropolitan to a Patriarchate.\n\nOur ecumenical patriarch has the most influence on this decision; the other Patriarchs are likely to follow his lead. A Patriarch who is considerably weaker than us, or even a prisoner of heretics or heathens, would be much likelier to agree to surrender some of his authority to us."
 request_autonomy_title: "§G†§! Request Autonomy for our church"
 request_autonomy_desc: "Our state church is an arm of the patriarchate, and as a result our people suffer through services in other languages. If we asked our Exarch to appeal to the Patriarch, he might grant us the boon of autonomy, giving us the right to preach the gospel in our native language."
 request_council_title: "§G†§! Request an Ecumenical Council"
 request_council_desc: "Beginning with the Council of Nicea, the Catholic church had made important decisions via consensus during church-wide councils. Many in our nation believe that now, another council is needed. We could use our influence with the Holy See to try and make his holiness see our point of view."
 request_dispensation_bribe_title: "§G†§! Send gifts to the pope to aid our case"
 request_dispensation_bribe_desc: "When a ruler faced censure from the church, $RULER_S_PRONOUN$ could request dispensation from a higher authority: the pope. Yet popes were mortal men, and involved in the affairs of princes. A wise or desperate ruler might pave the way for reconciliation with gold."
 request_dispensation_title: "§G†§! Request dispensation from the pope"
 request_dispensation_desc: "When a ruler faced censure from the church, $RULER_S_PRONOUN$ could request dispensation from a higher authority: the pope. We can instruct our archbishop to make a case in the Holy See for us to be welcomed back into the Catholic church."
 restore_catholicos_of_armenia_title: "§G†§! Restore the Catholicos of Armenia"
 restore_catholicos_of_armenia_desc: "Etchmiadzin Cathedral is the seat of the Catholicos of the Mother Church of Armenia, the leader of all Armenian Oriental Christians. Sadly neglected over the centuries, it could be restored and the Catholicos once again seated upon his throne."
 secular_courts_catholic_title: "§G†§! Close canonical courts"
 secular_courts_catholic_desc: "During the middle ages the church policed itself, with its own independent laws and courts. Ecclesiastical courts tended to be more lenient than secular ones; crimes that normally resulted in execution of the guilty, such as sodomy or bestiality, usually resulted in sentences of pilgrimages or public confession in ecclesiastical courts. As a result, anyone who could somehow claim clerical status, such as university students, asked to be tried under an ecclesiastical court - sometimes by appealing directly to the pope in [the_vatican.GetCapitalName]. While perfectly legal, this was not always popular with the public, and as the power of the papacy waned, some countries began stripping clerics of this privilege.\n\nThis decision will shield us from the Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction event."
 secularize_order_title: "§G†§! Secularise the Order"
 secularize_order_desc: "The Reformation criticised the role of priests and monks. Even faithful Catholics began to have doubts about them, and record numbers of priests and monks walked away from their vows to embrace secular life. Facing a crisis of faith, grandmasters had to chart a path for their nation to survive, and the obvious solution was to become a monarchy rather than a theocracy."
 cannot_border_heathens: "You do not border heathen countries"
 seek_elders_blessing_title: "§G†§! Seek the blessing of a holy hermit"
 seek_elders_blessing_desc: "Monks who eschewed civilisation and lived by themselves in the wilderness were considered the height of holiness in the Orthodox church. As hermits, they were not part of the standard church hierarchy, yet lived saintly lives devoted to God. Pilgrims seeking advice or blessings from a holy man sought out such hermits, even in the depths of the wilderness. Even rulers were known to do so at times, even though it took them away from the capital for some time."
 suppress_inquisition_title: "§G†§! Suppress the inquisition"
 suppress_inquisition_desc: "The inquisition was effective but unpopular. Without heresy to fight, the inquisition turned on recent converts and Catholics accused of blasphemy by their neighbours. This could be a useful scapegoat, but it won the inquisition no friends. Some rulers fought the inquisition's influence, but doing so could be difficult once it had gained roots in the country."
 uniate_church_title: "§G†§! Create a Uniate Church"
 uniate_church_desc: "Orthodox Christianity and Catholicism had no love lost between them, despite centuries of working together. Perhaps we can change that by instituting a Uniate church in our lands. With the support of the pope, we will allow Orthodox Christians to retain their liturgical practises, allow Orthodox clergy to marry, and exempt Orthodox priests from forced labour. In return, Orthodox Christians must accept papal authority, unleavened Eucharist bread, the existence of authority and the truth of the Filioque. This compromise will allow the two faiths to live in peace."
 union_of_florence_title: "§G†§! Unite the two churches"
 union_of_florence_desc: "The schism between east and west was regretted by both sides, and from time to time the pope or patriarch would try to resolve it through negotiation with their counterpart during church councils. The ecumenical council going on right now gives us the opportunity to unite the churches once more...but on their terms, not ours. Our desperation and weakness gives us little choice but to accept the supremacy of [the_vatican.GetCapitalName] and adopt most of their ways if we want their aid against the infidel! The pope has promised to call a crusade to aid us should we do so, although that promise means little unless we ourselves go to war."
 union_of_florence_promise_title: "§G†§! Acknowledge the primacy of the Pope"
 union_of_florence_promise_desc: "We promised to convert at the Church Council. The Pope has agreed to give us time to make the changes needed to introduce the Catholic religion in our lands, but if we wish to push for change now, we can do so."
 cenobitic_monastery: "Cenobium"
 desc_cenobitic_monastery: "Orthodox monks sometimes lived together, tilling the fields and living lives of devout prayer. These cenobitic monasteries were deliberately built away from cities, inadvertently spreading the Orthodox faith along the frontiers of the nation."
