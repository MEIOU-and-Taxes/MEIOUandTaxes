 setup_event.102.desc: "MEIOU and Taxes 3.0 - Path to Modernity is an EUIV Total Conversion Mod, brought to you by Gigau, KJH, Firekahuna, VineFynn, Justice Fighter, Beorsferth, Hameigh, Mepper, ShirokumaCoffee, Sun_Wu, Aldaron, PełPeł, Jervaj, dgl, Moridin997, Mati, Ben, FraughtGYRE, William, Corlis and the whole M&T team. Thanks for downloading our mod! Whether you've played the mod before, or are totally new, we really hope you enjoy your experience! M&T contains myriads of new provinces as well as tons of new countries compared to vanilla. \n\nThe game has been radically reworked from the ground up with a number of underlying simulation systems. Most notably the introduction of the new class based population system which replaces the vanilla development system. Also an entirely dynamic economic system based on supply and demand, including trade, wages, inter-class as well as state taxes and so much more.\n\nIf you have any questions about how the system work, you should check out our wiki at: https://meiouandtaxes.miraheze.org/wiki/Main_Page If there are more questions feel free to contact us in our Paradox Sub-Forum (EUIV/Modding/MEIOUandTaxes) \n\nWith this event, you can select\n- a difficulty level\n- additional formable tags.\n\nAfter selecting the options, select if you want to lock the settings or not. If you select "Settings unlocked", you will have a decision to trigger an event to change the settings later in the game, like changing the difficulty level, should you want to increase the difficulty later on, for example.\n\nAdditional Tags are a number of formable nations from outside the mod's timeframe, like the North Sea Empire or a number of tags that might have existed, but actually never did (tooltip will show you the potential formable tags added)."

 personality.01.t: "Amateurish Pettifogger"
 personality.01.d: "The character loves to debate various topics and dabbles in diplomacy, the trouble is they are awful at such things. Lacking social skills, tact and the charisma for the sensitive art of diplomacy does not prevent them from meddling in it, however."
 personality.02.t: "Brilliant Strategist"
 personality.02.d: "This character is a genius of tactics and strategy. This character has mastered fully the art of war, and is more at ease on the battlefield than anywhere else. His plans are so devious and effective, he is able to devise strategies that win battles again and again. In this chaotic world, few are capable enough to be called brilliant strategists."
 personality.03.t: "Charismatic Negotiator"
 personality.03.d: "The character is well versed and accomplished in the art of diplomacy. Blessed with a blend of charisma and intelligence, they are able diplomats and have a little trouble at persuading others to see their side of things."
 personality.04.t: "Elusive Shadow"
 personality.04.d: "This character is a renowned genius in the area of politics. They are intelligent, crafty, and wily. Their schemes and plans are so complex many are simply unable to comprehend their enormous genius. This tends to be very frustrating for this character and they end up becoming a lone wolf. They would rather keep away from those who do not understand them or their genius."
 personality.05.t: "Flamboyant Schemer"
 personality.05.d: "This character loves intrigue and gossip in the court. They are usually very intelligent and the mind games and schemes they concoct are mostly for the sport of it and not for the good of the realm."
 personality.06.t: "Gruff Diplomat"
 personality.06.d: "The character has been trained in the art of diplomacy and is able to break a deal or two to further their goals, lacking without finesse or grace. The character may be able to strike profitable agreements, but falls short of achieving greatness in their work."
 personality.07.t: "Hopeless Spender"
 personality.07.d: "The character was trained in stewardship and has come to love money, and unfortunately, they love spending it even more. To make matters worse, they are not very good at making money and are quick to lose any fortune they had to begin with. You will definitely not want this character."
 personality.08.t: "Intricate Webweaver"
 personality.08.d: "This character has mastered the art of politics. They are talented at devising plots and dreaming up elaborate schemes that almost never fail to succeed as planned."
 personality.09.t: "Knowledgeable Tactician"
 personality.09.d: "The character is a great soldier and a competent leader on the battlefield. His training and natural talent make him a powerful force of war. He has grasped tactical thinking and has a superb understanding of how war should be fought. War is something of an art to him."
 personality.10.t: "Midas Touched"
 personality.10.d: "The character was born with the talent to make large sums of money. They have the natural ability to turn more or less anything into golden success. Excellent in stewardship beyond the levels of most others, the character is destined to invite everlasting wealth and prosperity for the realm."
 personality.11.t: "Misguided Warrior"
 personality.11.d: "The character was educated to become a leader of men, but failed to learn anything but personal combat. He might be a fine warrior, but anything beyond basic tactics and strategy is lost on him."
 personality.12.t: "Naive Puppet Master"
 personality.12.d: "The character believes himself to be a master politician and a brilliant judge of people. This, however, could not be further from the truth, as their own ineptitude is apparent to all but them. They are constantly meddling in the affairs of the realm, causing mayhem and mischief more often than not."
 personality.13.t: "Silver Tongue"
 personality.13.d: "The character is not only very good at stewardship, he or she, is also imaginative and skilled in finding new profitable areas of investment. The characters intellectual agility allows them to make grand statements of promise to those foolish enough to buy into their designs. Very talented at making money and a very persuasive and sharp merchant."
 personality.14.t: "Tough Soldier"
 personality.14.d: "The character is a fine warrior and an average leader of men in battle. The character will perform well on the battlefield, yet falls short of becoming anything more. This man is best suited on the battlefield leading other soldiers, and not planning elaborate strategies."
 personality.15.t: "Grey Eminence"
 personality.15.d: "The character has mastered the art of diplomacy and uses their superior intellect and natural charm to further along negotiations of all kinds. Tactful, calm, persuasive and a brilliant planner they are able to get whatever they want. The character is an obvious genius and has a very bright future in the world of diplomacy."
 personality.21.t: "Crafty Merchant"
 personality.21.d: "The character was trained in stewardship and has become quite skilled in making money as well. Although they do not excel at governance or mercantile pursuits, they are able enough to manage smaller enterprises effectively."
 personality.22.t: "Fanatical Priest"
 personality.22.d: "This character is utterly obsessed with the life of priesthood. In other words, this character is consumed with the rigours and daily tasks of being a proper priest or holy man. The problem is that this person is so consumed with their occupation that it leaves little or no time for anything else and has become detached from worldly affairs."
 personality.23.t: "Martial Cleric"
 personality.23.d: "This character's studies in theology has left a permanent mark on them. They believe in their religious convictions deeply, and see no qualms of talking loudly and carrying a big stick to enforce the religious status quo. A natural crusader."
 personality.24.t: "Master Theologian"
 personality.24.d: "This character has a mastery of the subject of theology. This character is considered to be something of a genius, and excels at all things academic and scholarly. This character is best suited at administration or being an advisor to a liege as they tend to be high above their peers."
 personality.25.t: "Scholarly Theologian"
 personality.25.d: "The character is an academic, refined and well versed in the holy scripture. Being a sharp individual he or she will do well in matters of the mind, though the fascination for theological issues tends to absorb most of their intellectual thought."

 flavor_brb.1.t: "The death of John III of Brabant and Limburg without male issue plunged the Low Countries into uproar. By decree of the late Duke, his oldest daughter, Joanna of Brabant, was to remain the sole ruler of the realm. Joanna's younger sister Margaret, backed by her influential husband, Louis de Male, the Count of Flanders, has laid claim to the title herself in an attempt to usurp the Duchy. Louis's invasion of Brabantian soil left no doubt about who pulled the strings behind the claim of his wife. Their children stand to inherit the whole Duchy should the invasion succeed. The Count of Flanders commands a far stronger army than we can hope to field, perhaps we should try to convince him to make peace with an offer he can't refuse: the flourishing city of Antwerp has been on his mind for years, it would surely make a prize worth settling for."

 flavor_brb.4.n: "Flanders Refuses Peace"
 flavor_brb.4.t: "Louis de Male has foolishly denied our request for peace and is poised to take a large part of our lands for himself.

However, this action revokes their ancient privileges and this might anger the local nobles as well as the burghers and the peasantry, who would bear the most of the tax burden.\n\nUpon the creation of the Seventeen Provinces, representatives from all over the Low Countries have been called to the Estates-General of the Netherlands. You can demand taxes and manpower from them, and they will vote on your request and come to a decision. Too many requests might anger them and increase the chances that they refuse. Also, you can increase the centralisation efforts in the Low Countries every 50 years. This increases the level of the Estates-General province modifier (there are 3 levels), thus reducing autonomy in the provinces. Also, increasing centralisation increases the money and manpower they give you upon accepting your tax/manpower requests. Finally, more centralisation decreases the chance that people will be angry at you if you try to subjugate them via using the diplomatic action. Thus, increasing centralisation efforts before attempting to subjugate is highly recommended.\n\nYou can access this event via taking the 'More Information on the Seventeen Provinces' decision."

Born to a condottiero in Tuscany he grew up in the Kingdom of Naples, where he was granted a small fief. Having distinguished himself as a skilled field commander in the War of L'Aquila and other expeditions he was employed subsequently by the King of Naples, the Pope and the Duke of Milan. \n\nAnno domini 1432 he was betrothed to the Duke's only child Bianca Maria, though the marriage did not take place until 1441 when Bianca came of age. Despite the betrothal, Sforza changed sides multiple times in the following years to both Venice and Florence, acquiring various fiefs in the process. Eventually he returned to the Milanese after being offered the title of Capitano Generale. \n\nFollowing the troubles the short-lived Ambrosian Republic brought upon Milan, the senate bestowed onto him the title Duke of Milan, due to his marriage to the late Duke's only natural child and his military prowess. His entry into the city on 22 March 1450 marked the end of the Ambrosian Republic and laid the foundation for almost a century of Sforza rule in Milan."

This was an indication of a great social mobility within the Maratha Empire, enabling its rapid expansion. During this era, Peshwas belonging to the (Bhat) Deshmukh Marathi Brahmin family controlled the Maratha army and later became the hereditary rulers of the Maratha Empire from 1749 to 1818. During their reign, the Maratha empire reached its zenith ruling most of the Indian Subcontinent. Prior to 1700, one Peshwa received the status of imperial regent for eight or nine years. They oversaw the greatest expansion of the Maratha Empire around 1760 with the help of Sardars like Holkar, Scindia (Shinde), Bhosale, and Gaekwad (Dhane).

However, Marie of Blois, Dowager Duchess of Anjou finally cancelled the negotiations, and then Gian Galeazzo turned his attention to his nephew-by-marriage Louis, Duke of Touraine, second son of King Charles V of France and brother of the reigning Charles VI.
