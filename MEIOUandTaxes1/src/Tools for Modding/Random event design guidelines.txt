### How to Design Balanced Random Events OR 'Stop screwing up the game balance and making me fix it!' ###
### By Malorn ###

First let's define a 'random' event. Random events are events that are not meant to link into overall game systems. So something like the rebellions events, which are meant to simulate cultural unrest,
or something like the weather systems, which simulates weather across a larger area, would not be considered random events. Random events may have set triggers and still be random, any event which is not
part of a game system, a disaster, or a scripted early game event should be considered a random event. DHEs are ESPECIALLY considered random events and should follow these rules.

Rule 1: A random event should not provide a net benefit or disadvantage. Random events, and their options, should have penalties and bonuses built into them. Random chances can also be used, with increased benefits
	or penalties for the chance, of course. An event option could, for example, have a chance of a downside with a benefit, or a chance of a benefit with a set downside. But the overall goal is an event which, if it
	fired very often, would result in a different nation, but not one which was better or worse off. This is EXTREMELY important to random event balance.

Rule 2: Do not make random events that are too extreme in effect. A random event should not provide a huge effect, even when it's a net neutral. Equally, do not make random events that are too minor in effect. This is a
	popup that requires player attention, and CPU time, make sure it's worth it.


Strong suggestion 1: MTTH modifiers require the game to check those triggers, don't overdo it there. CPU is good.

Strong suggestion 2: Province events scale a LOT over a large nation. Use is_mtth_scaled_to_size on most random province level events. Event spam is bad.

Strong suggestion 3: There is nothing wrong with a 'do nothing' option on a random event. There may be opportunities a nation may not want to exploit.

Strong suggestion 4: Make AI_will_do logic for anything complex or risky. It doesn't have to be perfect, but anything helps.


If we follow these rules, making random events, and thus flavour, should be fairly easy, and most importantly, will not need to so tightly controlled. With that in mind, existing and future random events will be held to
this standard, and will either be reworked or deleted as needed.

Random note: if you want to enable colonization temporarily for a tag, give them can_colonize_country_modifier for a limited time. This modifier simply enables the 3.0 expeditions
