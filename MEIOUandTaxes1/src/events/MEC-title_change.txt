# SUMMARY
# Purpose - to change the tier levels
# count <> marquis <> duke <> prince/grand duke <> king <> emperor
#
# OVERVIEW
# - For HRE members, promotion requires authorization of the Emperor
# - For non HRE catholic nations, the authorization of the Pope <- to be checked for Anti Pope
# - For vassals, the authorization of the overlord
# - For the others, a high prestige.
# - shugos get promoted to sengoku and sengokus get demoted to shugo
# - a powerful enough sengoku gets promoted to shogun
# - if the shogun is still powerful, the following one becomes contender
#
