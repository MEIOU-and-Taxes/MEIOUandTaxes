The following files were created for adding new diplomatic actions and MUST NOT
be deleted, even if empty:
	02_alliance.txt
	03_influence.txt
	04_relation.txt
	05_dynasty.txt
	06_covert.txt
	07_economy.txt
	08_access.txt
	09_emperor.txt
	10_papacy.txt
	11_great_powers.txt

Their name (minus ordering prefix) is equivalent to the category they represent,
i.e. people do not have to research the categories themselves. They are ordered
in the same way as they appear in-game, from top to bottom.

If PDS adds new diplomatic action categories, changes their ordering, removes or
renames old ones, feel free to reflect those changes by adding/removing/renaming
category files accordingly.
