A complete overhaul for Europa Universallis IV, featuring an extended and more detailed map, a real economy, political simulation, multiple new mechanics and systems built upon an earlier start date of 1356.

This mod has been formed by the merger of two major EUIII mods: MEIOU created in 2007, and Death & Taxes created in 2011, following the announcement of Europa Universalis IV. The former's name is a play on the old Habsburg motto AEIOU. Which means Autria Est Imperare Orbi Universo or, in English, "it is Austria's destiny to rule the world". We changed the first word from Austria to Mihi, changing the meaning to "it is my destiny to rule the world". The second is based on a quote of Benjamin Franklin: "in this world, nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes."

- Fifteen-hundred new provinces and counting, as well as new nations.
- Extends the timeline, offering five hundred years of history (1356-1856).
- Reworked religious mechanics inspired by Dharper's Dei Gratia, revamped completely for MEIOU and Taxes 3.0.
    - Religious minorities for all provinces based on real population
    - Immersive religious conversion with Entrenchment, Infrastructure and Misisonary mechanics
    - Expansive event chains and mechanics for many religions, especially for the Protestant Reformation
- A simulated economy and population as the backbone of the game, providing real tax, production and manpower outputs
    - Historical population for the entire world in 1356, with a realistic growth model to map historical trends
    - Detailed production system with industries, goods and services to meet various forms of demand
    - Global trade system allowing bidirectional trade of real goods and fully costed profits
    - A global migration system integrating economics and politics
- A socioeconomic political model, integrating economics and politics with new Estate, State and government mechanics
    - Rights and Reforms system to represent the various political structures over the centuries of gameplay
    - Real Elites based on population, wealth that exert political power both locally and in the central government
    - Detailed manpower and military system using wealth and population as the basis of manpower, with population-impacting military losses
- New subject integration system.
- Overhauled graphics and map courtesy of EOOQE.
- New Disease system modelling different strains and spread models
- Revamped and Reworked Colonial System
- A unique musical score composed by ciadude2.

The Traveler is a submod for MEIOU and Taxes v3.0, originally created by FireKahuna, revived and now maintained by Micha "Mepper" Helder. 

Original Traveler by FireKahuna:
An expansive map mod for MEIOU and Taxes v3.0, focusing on Anatolia, the Balkans, the North and South Caucasus, Eastern Europe, Scandinavia, the Levant, Iran, Siberia, Manchuria, Mongolia, Korea, Japan, Arabia, North Africa and the Greater Steppe with new tags, provinces, trade nodes, mechanics and more.

Restore Rome in all its glory with an expanded Anatolia and Greece setup, reworked provinces, cultures and improved missions, or establish a new Roman state under Trebizond with a new detailed province setup for the Pontus. New wastelands across Eastern Anatolia provides more strategic gameplay, and a strong border for any future Anatolian state, accompanying the many additions to the Eastern Balkans and refined Serbian setup.

Play through the collapse of the Yuan as a breakaway Mongol state under the Northern Yuan system, attempt to establish a new state in Manchuria as a commission of the Ming, or restore the ancient borders of Goguryeo as Korea. An extensive cultural overall, complete map rework and new mechanics provide the framework for representing the Northern Yuan era for the Mongols, and the rise of the Jurcen clans.

Save Alania from destruction, restoring the ancient borders and driving the hordes from an ancient land. Or unite Circassia as one of the 12 tribes, creating a powerful state to challenge dominion of the area. Over a dozen new tags, tens of provinces and new wastelands provide a completely new experience for both sides of the Caucasus.

All work on the map done by FireKahuna where different from base M&T

Changes by Mepper where the Traveler differs from base M&T: 

- Integrated Submod: Dynamic Province Names for MEIOU and Taxes, which adds a bunch of extra dynamic province names for Dutch and minor Dutch Cultures (researched by yours truly), Polish (researched by Mati) and Welsh (by jackb0nes13 and Benfras)
- Trade Centers can not Trade if they are occupied (they can be trade with but they act on their own)
- Long Distance Trade can be stopped by a Naval Blockade of the Capital TN which initiates the Trade
- Rename countries to local names (partially implemented only)
- Update .mod files; Make Traveler name show in Launcher; prevent confuse
- Looting is more potent than on main M&T, loots and destroys more
- Base demand of pops for salt is 25% more than in base M&T
- There was a 15% startup wealth buff in both main and Traveler, removed it for Traveler
- Includes more flavor work by Piterdaw and falanxidaobojue than base M&T
- Manchu nations can form Qing when they claim the Mandate of Heaven
- Army rebel suppression at max is better than on main (-10 instead of -5)
- Tribal levies are less efficient
- AE and core cost have been reduced to account for the extra provinces
- AI will more often want to loot heavier
- AI is at base more aggressive
- Make Chinese Subtags not ally eachother when China Broke
